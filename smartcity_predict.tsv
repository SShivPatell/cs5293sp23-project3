1Introduction 
William T. Coleman, Jr., the fourth Secretary of 
TransportaƟ  on, painted a picture of the ways 
in which our society would travel and interact. Under his leadership, the U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on set about creaƟ  ng a planning 
and decision-making framework to guide that future.  Secretary Coleman’s future became reality…for most of the country.  For others, Ɵ me seemed to stand sƟ  ll and liƩ  le progress 
was made. Such is the case for the City of Birmingham.
Fast forward to today.  Under the leadership 
of Secretary of TransportaƟ  on Anthony Foxx, 
the U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on has 
developed a 30-year transportaƟ  on plan for 
the naƟ  on.  The plan, enƟ  tled Beyond Traﬃ   c, 
has a very clear thesis: the United States needs to pivot away from its reliance on the car towards mobility systems that are beƩ  er 
suited to ciƟ  es.  We couldn’t agree more!
The City of Birmingham will be one of the 
U.S. ciƟ  es that helps the naƟ  on achieve its 
transportaƟ  on vision.  The City is reemerging 
as a vibrant southern city, a place where people choose to live, businesses can innovate, grow, and thrive, and visitors seek out for historic, cultural, and recreaƟ  onal 
experiences. Through careful comprehensive community planning, good leadership, collaboraƟ  on and targeted investment, 
Birmingham is taking advantage of new opportuniƟ  es, and improving the overall 
quality of life for its residents.  Renewed investment in the City’s transportaƟ  on system 
will breathe new life into the City, especially those areas that are experiencing urban decay.Our City 
Located in a dramaƟ  c physical landscape, 
Birmingham is the county seat of Jeﬀ  erson 
County and is the largest city in Alabama.  It is ﬂ  anked by parallel mountain ridges of 
the southern extension of the Appalachian Mountains, which contain the minerals upon which the city’s early heavy industry was founded. MulƟ  ple railroad corridors that 
thread their way through the Birmingham area were the key to the city’s development as an industrial powerhouse, facilitaƟ  ng the 
transformaƟ  on of the area’s rich mineral 
wealth into one of the naƟ  on’s most important 
sources of iron and steel during the Industrial RevoluƟ  on. 
Economic decline iniƟ  ated by populaƟ  on 
ﬂ ight to the suburbs was exacerbated by the 
concurrent mass exodus of heavy industrial jobs from Birmingham. The iron and steel industry had long been the foundaƟ  on of 
middle income prosperity in Birmingham. However, by the 21st century, this keystone had been eﬀ  ecƟ vely pulled from Birmingham’s 
economic arch. 
As the eﬀ  ects of the Great Recession of 
2008 are waning, Birmingham is gaining vitality and populaƟ  on. This is in part thanks 
to a mammoth eﬀ  ort to reinvent itself as a 
more livable community, aƩ  racƟ  ve for the 
businesses and professionals that will drive our economy in the 21st century. The Smart City concepts presented herein will support this renewal and help expand economic opportunity to Birmingham’s long neglected  minority and low-income neighborhoods.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census’s 
Designated Place data, the City of Birmingham had a populaƟ  on of 212,237.  At that Ɵ  me, 
the City comprised 28.3% of the urbanized area’s total populaƟ  on, and had an average 
populaƟ  on density of 1,453 persons per  Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
2square mile.  This is well within the populaƟ  on 
and density characterisƟ  cs of a Smart City.
According the U.S. Bureau of the Census’s 
LEHD, the City of Birmingham contains approximately 163,000 jobs, of which just under 130,000 are located in the awarded Birmingham BRT corridor. The Downtown and UAB/Five Points South subareas combined have over 70,000 jobs, which is approximately 43 percent of the City’s total jobs, and 54 percent of the jobs in the BRT corridor.  The BRT corridor plays an important role in our vision to transform Birmingham into a Smart City. The vision will be arƟ  culated more clearly 
later in this response.
Other things to know about the City of 
Birmingham include:
• Birmingham has 99 neighborhoods
• Birmingham is the Southeast’s premier 
medical mecca
• 18,,500 students are enrolled in UAB
• Close to 80 percent of the State of Alabama’s populaƟ  on is within a 100 mile 
radius of the City of Birmingham
• Birmingham is served by ﬁ  ve (5) interstate 
highways: I-20, I-59, I-65, I-22, and I-459
• Birmingham is served by three (3) Tier 1 rail providers
• 60 percent of the 11 state Southeastern market can be reached by truck within one-day’s freight travel Ɵ  me
• 90 percent of the U.S. populaƟ  on can be 
reached by truck within a three-day freight travel Ɵ  me
In terms of how the City of Birmingham relates 
to the State of Alabama and the synergisƟ  c 
role of the two enƟ  Ɵ es, know that  Alabama 
is now the ﬁ  Ō h largest auto producing state, 
and employment in the sector is approaching 40,000. Alabama’s three global automakers, Mercedes-Benz, Honda and Hyundai, combined to produce more than 1 million 
vehicles in 2015, the ﬁ  rst Ɵ  me the state’s 
annual output has reached that big-league milestone.  All three automakers are exploring, and have incorporated autonomous vehicle technology into their vehicles.  This technology includes everything from navigaƟ  on systems, 
to communicaƟ  ons and entertainment 
systems, to automaƟ  c braking, and crash 
avoidance systems.
Automobile and parts manufacturing, and the 
technology that accompanies it has become the state ’s top e xport category , reaching $6.6 
billion in 2014. New auto-related investment in the sector during the past four-years tops $5.5 billion. 
Birmingham city closely aligns with the 
USDOT’s characterisƟ  cs for a Smart City, as it 
provides:
• ExisƟ  ng public transportaƟ  on system 
and plans for new addiƟ  ons to the public 
transportaƟ  on services; 
• Environment that is conducive to 
demonstraƟ  ng proposed strategies;
• Leadership with proven record of 
commitment and dedicaƟ  on, and the 
capacity to carry out the demonstraƟ  on 
throughout the period of performance;
• A solid commitment to integraƟ  ng with 
the sharing economy and share assets in a seamless way; and
• A clear commitment to open data and data sharing, thus making data accessible and usable by the public to maximize beneﬁ  t 
and promote entrepreneurship and innovaƟ  on. Become America’s Next Smart City
3Our Challenge
The City of Birmingham is challenged to 
meet its mobility needs because of its poor transportaƟ  on connecƟ  vity across all modes, 
underuƟ  lizaƟ  on of exisƟ  ng transportaƟ  on 
resources, limited transit, bicycle, and pedestrian opƟ  ons, and aging/crumbling 
and outdated transportaƟ  on infrastructure.  
The transportaƟ  on system has been cited 
as a barrier to opportuniƟ  es and access to 
both health services and healthy foods.  The historic network of roadways is not friendly to pedestrians or cyclists, and the general lack of pedestrian faciliƟ  es and inter-community 
connecƟ  ons are all contributors to a widening 
gap in socio-economic condiƟ  ons.  In addiƟ  on, 
the City of Birmingham also is confronted with a declining total populaƟ  on, an aging ciƟ  zen 
base, and concentraƟ  ons of poverty. Each of 
these issues is exacerbated by the poor quality of the exisƟ  ng transportaƟ  on system.
AddiƟ  onally, the City does not have 
informaƟ  on systems built. The technology and 
data that currently exists are disconnected and isolated, and endures in pockets/silos. The challenge is to integrate it all -- the systems, the technology, the informaƟ  on – and to exploit its 
power to the fullest.
Our Opportunities
The City is transforming rapidly and its change is inevitable.  Birmingham’s downtown is already experiencing a resurgence, and the City as a whole is undergoing a regeneraƟ  on of 
its ninety-nine (99) neighborhoods. The City’s revitalizaƟ  on eﬀ  orts are largely focused on: 
improving quality of life for ciƟ  zens; protecƟ  ng 
and enhancing the unique sense of place; rebuilding the economy with a foundaƟ  on 
of diversity and resiliency; and orientaƟ  on 
toward innovaƟ  on and a healthy workforce. 
Birmingham and its greater region are strategically targeƟ  ng catalyƟ  c transportaƟ  on 
and land use/land development eﬀ  orts in a 
handful of core areas and travel corridors, and are beginning to realize success through these areas successful transformaƟ  on.  For this 
success to conƟ  nue, the City of Birmingham 
needs to make a “big leap”, and modernize its transportaƟ  on infrastructure and service 
delivery. However, modernizaƟ  on does not 
mean looking to the status quo. Instead, the City of Birmingham is looking to become a naƟ onal leader for urban mobility.
In 2015, the U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on 
awarded the City of Birmingham a TIGER VII grant to build a bus rapid transit (BRT) system in three (3) disƟ  ncƟ ve travel corridors and 
the Birmingham City Center.  The provision of Federal funding to assist with the development of this important infrastructure component is a criƟ  cal catalyƟ  c element for the project.  The 
BRT itself is one of the larger catalyƟ  c elements 
intended to support, and in some cases help jump start, the redevelopment of impoverished neighborhoods.  The hope and promise of the BRT system is that it will usher in a new era of travel for the City of Birmingham; that it will strengthen the City’s diverse communiƟ  es 
by connecƟ  ng them to services and linking 
residents to opportuniƟ  es. However, the City’s 
transportaƟ  on transformaƟ  on does not end 
here as this is just the beginning.
Our Vision
Our vision is to uƟ  lize new transportaƟ  on 
and infrastructure technologies, Smart City elements, and innovaƟ  ve urban 
transportaƟ  on approaches to transform 
the City of Birmingham into a modern, thriving community that showcases the transformaƟ  onal power of the Smart City 
concept on mobility, accessibility, economic growth, land development, equity, and quality of life Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
4The City of Birmingham is looking to remake 
itself into a 21st Century City.  Its leadership has a renewed commitment to the City’s growth and development, and is acƟ  vely 
seeking new ways to aƩ  ract new talent and 
business.  They know that in order to achieve the vision that they have set for Birmingham’s future and overcome its past deﬁ  cits, that they 
need to take bold acƟ  ons to remediate the 
City’s transportaƟ  on system.
The City of Birmingham has a strong desire for 
its transportaƟ  on system to establish a broad 
reach, linking the City and the region that it serves to new markets and desƟ  naƟ ons around 
the world. At the same Ɵ  me Birmingham’s 
leadership is seeking to take advantage of both the City’s geographic locaƟ  on and 
historic legacy as the “PiƩ  sburgh of the 
South”, building upon the exisƟ  ng inter-modal 
freight rail network, and capitalizing on its new interstate connecƟ  ons --gaining from the 
combined strengths of individual modes.
Birmingham’s vision for its transformaƟ  on 
reﬂ ect a city that is intelligent in character--
harnessing the tremendous power of digital social networks, elements of the sharing economy, and technological advancements to expand its economic and social capabiliƟ  es, 
and exploit its tremendous potenƟ  al.  It 
is inclusive in its services-- always moving forward, leaving no one behind. The transportaƟ  on system is innovaƟ  ve in its scope. 
It derives its beneﬁ  t from integrated data, 
technology and smarter use of its exisƟ  ng 
infrastructure.
The City of Birmingham’s vision is closely 
linked with the ideas expressed in both its comprehensive plan. The Comprehensive Plan holisƟ  cally addresses the development of its 
communiƟ  es, looking at economic condiƟ  ons, 
land development paƩ  erns and trends, 
transportaƟ  on needs, human health dispariƟ  es, 
and the overall quality of life. FacilitaƟ  ng community reinvestment, especially in the low-
income and minority neighborhoods, is one of the primary goals of Birmingham’s response to the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge. Through its 
inclusive planning process and strategic public investment, the City of Birmingham has set in moƟ  on an economic engine that is gaining 
the momentum needed to restore prosperity to Birmingham’s neighborhoods. The new construcƟ  on occurring in the Parkside District 
and Woodlawn are evidence that with targeted public investment community renewal is possible.
The City’s approach to catalyzing a renaissance 
of its neighborhoods is to center revitalizaƟ  on 
eﬀ orts around “strategic opportunity areas.” 
The strategic opportunity areas are acƟ  vity 
centers that contain the necessary economic, social, and transportaƟ  on resources to help 
them be successful.  The comprehensive plan calls for linking a number of strategic opportunity areas together along the BRT corridor like a string of pearls, and locaƟ  ng BRT 
staƟ ons within them.  This acknowledges the 
transformaƟ  ve power of transportaƟ  on, and is 
key to the City’s revitalizaƟ  on strategy. In short, 
the strategic opportunity areas are intended to serve mulƟ  ple funcƟ  ons, and are envisioned to 
be the catalysts for community reinvestment.  One of the funcƟ  ons intended for the strategic 
opportunity areas is for them to serve as “mobility hubs”. 
Mobility Hubs are an aƩ  empt to address the 
negaƟ  ves brought about by land development 
paƩ erns that responds exclusively to a single 
travel mode, the automobile, and whose supporƟ  ve infrastructure (i.e. wide, high-
speed arterial roadways, parking faciliƟ  es, 
etc.), discourages the movement and use of other transportaƟ  on modes.  They are places 
of connecƟ  vity where diﬀ  erent modes of 
transportaƟ  on – from walking to biking to 
transit to shared ride services – come together seamlessly. They also support intensive  Become America’s Next Smart City
5concentraƟ  ons of higher density development, 
accommodaƟ  ng places for people of all 
incomes, age, and ability to work, live, shop and/or play, and connecƟ  ng communiƟ  es to 
the rest of the region through reliable, rapid transit services. In essence, mobility hubs are acƟ vity centers that integrate land use and 
transportaƟ  on, and epitomize the City’s vision 
for its future.
Mobility hubs are hardly a household phrase. 
But the concept of a central places that links diﬀ erent modes of transportaƟ  on, as well as 
other things such as shopping, entertainment, recreaƟ  on and family services – is fundamental 
to the City of Birmingham’s vision for its revitalized communiƟ  es. They elevate the 
importance of public transit, cycling, and pedestrian travel. This elevaƟ  on of importance 
is criƟ  cal to ensuring the development of 
an eﬃ   cient, sustainable transportaƟ  on 
system. Public transit and non-motorized transportaƟ  on faciliƟ  es within the hubs help 
to reduce automobile travel, which impacts air quality. Equalizing and/or prioriƟ  zing cycling 
and pedestrian travel within mobility hubs also helps in addressing community health issues by providing employees, residents, and visitors to communiƟ  es that host mobility hubs the 
opportunity for walking and cycling. 
Mobility hubs are proposed t o be lo cated 
within neighborhood acƟ  vity centers, and are 
all about making it easier to move from one mode of transportaƟ  on to another, anchoring 
seamless, convenient connecƟ  ons across 
the metropolitan planning area. They’re also about improving the relaƟ  onship between 
transportaƟ  on and land use. There’s no point 
building a mobility hub in the proverbial “middle of nowhere.” In order for them to work, mobility hubs need t o be lo cated close 
to many people, whether they are at work, at home, or at play. In other words, they need to be livable.ComplemenƟ  ng the Birmingham BRT’s service 
design and capital investment, which will reduce the need for customers to travel to Birmingham’s downtown to transfer, mobility hubs will help customers access the BRT and other local transportaƟ  on opƟ  ons, as well as 
provide a viable, cost-eﬀ  ecƟ ve soluƟ  on for “last 
mile” connecƟ  ons.
Table 1 provides a descripƟ  on of how the 
mobility hubs are envisioned to work within the City of Birmingham.
IncorporaƟ  on of new technologies into the 
infrastructure, tesƟ  ng of automated and 
connected vehicle technologies, use of smart data collecƟ  on and sharing pracƟ  ces, smart 
land use, and user-focused mobility services are all of criƟ  cal importance to the successful 
implementaƟ  on of the Mobility Hubs concept.
Our vision is for the City of Birmingham to 
be a living laboratory for tesƟ  ng innovaƟ  ve 
transportaƟ  on concepts that will allow the City 
of Birmingham to close exisƟ  ng socioeconomic 
gaps that have been deﬁ  ning transportaƟ  on 
mobility, access to services, and growth opportuniƟ  es for years and provide enhanced 
transportaƟ  on opƟ  ons to move people 
and goods in a safer, more eﬃ   cient, more 
sustainable, and more equitable way. 
If selected for the Smart City Challenge, the 
City of Birmingham proposes to leverage exisƟ  ng resources, expand on recent 
transportaƟ
 on and urban planning iniƟ  aƟ ves, 
and introduce new technologies, strategies, and insƟ  tuƟ onal changes to address local 
transportaƟ  on challenges, spur economic 
development, and improve the quality of life for our ciƟ  zens. 
TransportaƟ  on opƟ  ons that are currently 
available or planned, and that will support the Mobility Hub concept include: Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
6• Traﬃ  c Management Center (TMC) . The 
City of Birmingham operates a Traﬃ   c 
Management Cent er (TMC), lo cated 
in Birmingham’s City Hall. The TMC is designed to monitor traﬃ   c using 
CCTV cameras and control traﬃ   c signal 
intersecƟ  ons, and proacƟ  vely deploy 
traﬃ  c management strategies to reduce 
congesƟ  on during special events, 
emergencies, or daily stop-and-go traﬃ   c.  
• Public TransportaƟ  on. In 2015, the City of 
Birmingham applied for and subsequently won a U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on 
TIGER VII grant to assist the City with the development of its long planned bus rapid transit (BRT) system. The BRT system will be the spine of a re-imagined transit system, where the BRT serves a series of mobility hubs, and local bus services feed the BRT system instead of running into a central locaƟ  on. The BRT is proposed to a 
10-minute frequency during the peak travel periods, and a 15-minute headway during the oﬀ  -peak periods.
• Local Bus Service improvements .  The 
Birmingham Jeﬀ  erson County Transit 
Authority also is undertaking a complete overhaul of its ﬁ  xed-route bus services. 
While the major improvements to local bus services are primarily focused on changes to routes, improvements also include technology upgrades such as automated vehicle locaƟ  on (AVL), real-Ɵ  me vehicle 
arrival systems, automated passenger counters (APC), and electronic payment systems.
• Car Sharing Program . The City of 
Birmingham hosts a car share program.  The University of Birmingham at Alabama (UAB) Car Share, is operated by a private enƟ ty and is currently limited to students 
and faculty at UAB.  Employed as part of the University’s congesƟ  on management 
strategy, the car share program provides these individuals who need a car for occasional use an opƟ  on to rent a vehicle 
for a short period of Ɵ  me.
• CommuteSmart . The City of Birmingham is 
an acƟ  ve partner in the Regional Planning 
Commission of Greater Birmingham’s CommuteSmart iniƟ  aƟ ve. CommuteSmart 
is a commuter services program that operates in the State of Alabama’s four (4) metropolitan transportaƟ  on management 
Table 1. Mobiliity Hub Typologies
Regional Mobility Hubs Serving mulƟ  ple communiƟ  es, regional mobility hubs serve regional 
acƟ vity centers and have the potenƟ  al for the highest levels of populaƟ  on 
and employment densiƟ  es, and that generate the highest levels of travel 
demand to and from these centers. PotenƟ  al transit travel modes include 
high-capacity public transportaƟ  on services such as Birmingham’s planned 
bus rapid transit (BRT) system, as well as express and local bu s services. 
Regional hubs are deﬁ  ned based on their scale, character, transit service 
availability and type, and funcƟ  on
Community Mobility Hubs Community scale mobility hubs serve majo r regional desƟ  naƟ ons and/

to maintain 35 vanpools.  They idenƟ  fy 
2,559 acƟ  ve carpools in the rideshare 
database.
• Commercial Shared Ride Services . The 
City of Birmingham recently passed an ordinance allowing shared ride services such as Uber and LyŌ   to operate within 
the City of Birmingham. Many of the City’s neighboring jurisdicƟ  ons followed suit soon 
aŌ er, noƟ  ng that it did not make sense 
for them to do so if Birmingham did not allow these services as Birmingham is the economic, cultural, and entertainment hub for the region.
• Inter-modal ConnecƟ  ons . The City of 
Birmingham is currently compleƟ  ng 
construcƟ  on on an inter-modal 
transportaƟ  on center in its downtown. 
The Birmingham Inter-modal Center will provide connecƟ  ons between local bus 
services, interregional and intercity bus services, passenger rail, taxi and shared ride services, bikeshare, and the City’s urban trail network.  
• Bikes Share StaƟ  ons/Bicycle FaciliƟ  es. 
Since 2015, the City of Birmingham is home to the Zyp Bikeshare program. Currently, Zyp Bikeshare is a dense network of kiosks and bikes whose exisƟ  ng services are 
primarily focused in Birmingham’s City Center and its adjacent neighborhoods.  Zyp has aspiraƟ  ons of expanding beyond 
downtown, and is looking to provide bikeshare across the City, as well as in neighboring ciƟ  es. The Zyp bikes are 
“smart bikes.” That is, the bicycles employ technology that knows where they are, and where they’ve been. Travelers can check their previous routes on the web or within Zyp Bikeshare’s app, a useful tool for individuals seeking to achieve a health goal, 
planning enƟ  Ɵ es looking to idenƟ  fy travel 
paƩ erns, or for folks who simply want to 
know where they have been. 
Along with state of the art bicycles, Zyp 
Bikeshare also employs sustainable docking staƟ ons. The staƟ  ons use clean energy, 
and are powered independently. Both the staƟ on and bikes are charged fully by solar 
panels. StaƟ  ons and bikes c ommuni cate 
with the larger network wirelessly. StaƟ  ons 
may be permanent. However, their design allows them to be portable so that they can be adapted temporarily for speciﬁ  c events.
The City of Birmingham envisions that 
Zyp Bikeshare staƟ  ons will be lo cated in 
all mobility hubs, and provide seamless connecƟ  ons for travelers who choose to 
use transit, walk, or drive to the acƟ  vity 
centers and the adjacent neighborhoods. 
• Car Share Access . Car sharing oﬀ  ers a 
potenƟ  al model for the City of Birmingham 
in its quest to become a Smart City.  While car sharing is not currently accessible beyond the UAB campus, car sharing can support Birmingham’s eﬀ  orts to revitalize 
communiƟ  es and make them more livable 
by reducing the need for addiƟ  onal/
larger roadway infrastructure and surface parking. AddiƟ  onally, car sharing can 
provide a potenƟ  al economic savings for 
both government and private companies 
 Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
8by helping to reduce their ﬂ  eet costs, 
minimize local transportaƟ  on expenses, 
and meet sustainability goals.
• Pedestrian FaciliƟ  es. In 2010, the 
Freshwater Land Trust, in partnership with the Jeﬀ  erson County Department of Health, 
completed the Red Rock Ridge and Valley Trail Plan (Red Rock) for Jeﬀ  erson County, 
home-county to the City of Birmingham.  The City of Birmingham subsequently adopted the Red Rock Plan and has since integrated it into it comprehensive plan and supporƟ  ng Community Framework Plans.  
In 2011, the City of Birmingham applied for and was awarded a TIGER IV grant. EnƟ  tled 
Roads to Recovery, the TIGER IV grant is the ﬁ rst phase of a planned Complete Streets 
and mulƟ  -modal transportaƟ  on system, 
and helped the City to jumpstart the implementaƟ  on of the Red Rock mulƟ  -use 
trail system.  To date, more than 27 miles of sidewalks, bike lanes, and oﬀ  -road trails 
have been constructed.
• Smart Parking . With roughly 4,700 
on-street parking meters and another 7,000 structured parking spaces, there is tremendous opportunity for the City of Birmingham to uƟ  lize interacƟ  ve parking 
systems that would help alleviate traﬃ   c 
congesƟ  on, provide CiƟ  zen and visitor 
convenience and increase City revenue.The City has reviewed several Smart 
Parking System soluƟ  ons and is preparing 
to procure a system that meets its desired needs, such as the ability to idenƟ  fy 
available open on-street parking spots and open spaces in parking garages on an interacƟ  ve map.  The desired system will 
also enable user to pay for parking using a smart phone app that is compaƟ  ble with 
IOS, Android and Windows. Users also would be noƟ  ﬁ ed when their meter Ɵ  me is 
about to expire.
 Become America’s Next Smart City
9In addiƟ  on to these Smart CiƟ  es strategies, the 
City of Birmingham also is acƟ  vely working to 
embrace freight transportaƟ  on as part of its 
vision for the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge.  Building 
on the region’s success in obtaining a TIGER I grant for the Birmingham Regional Inter-modal Freight facility, the City of Birmingham is looking to develop freight villages, integrated logisƟ  cs centers to take advantage 
of its exisƟ  ng rail, highway, and waterway 
infrastructure.
A freight village is a deﬁ  ned area within 
which all acƟ  viƟ es relaƟ  ng to transportaƟ  on, 
logisƟ  cs and the distribuƟ  on of goods, both for 
naƟ onal and internaƟ  onal transit, are carried 
out by various operators.  Freight villages, as envisioned for Birmingham, will accommodate state-of-the-art distribuƟ  on centers and 
industrial acƟ  viƟ es that serve large market 
areas, and shun passive acƟ  viƟ es such as 
container storage. These types of distribuƟ  on 
centers and automated manufacturing and industrial acƟ  viƟ es are already beginning 
to occur within the Greater Birmingham region around the automoƟ  ve manufacturing 
industry.
The City of Birmingham’s goal in developing 
freight villages is to leverage freight operaƟ  ons 
to create economic value for underuƟ  lized 
and abandoned industrial sites, and in parƟ  cular provide 
a strategy for the reuse of brownﬁ  eld sites.  The City also 
is looking to create shared value for the communiƟ  es in 
which the freight village would be located.  This includes the development and expansion of support businesses such as retail (restaurants, banking, stores), and hotels, as well as providing oﬃ   ce space for 
non-retail businesses. Other City goals to be accomplished through the development of freight villages 
include: a. increased rail mode share, b. improved environmental quality, and c. the creaƟ  on of a more eﬃ   cient and cost-eﬀ  ecƟ ve 
freight delivery system.
The City of Birmingham’s freight villages 
are envisioned to be lo cated adjacent to 
modal shiŌ   faciliƟ  es. Modal shiŌ   faciliƟ  es are 
themselves located within the freight village.  Modal shiŌ   faciliƟ  es are transportaƟ  on faciliƟ  es 
where goods are moved between two or more forms of freight transportaƟ  on such as rail to 
truck; barge to rail/truck; air and rail/truck.  They will be sensiƟ  ve to the surrounding land 
uses, blending in with their communiƟ  es, and 
contribuƟ  ng to the City’s quality of life.  Ideally, 
they will employ the City’s newly developed character based zoning criteria, showcasing how open space and industrial space can coexist, demonstraƟ  ng the City’s desire to 
Incorporate “green building” techniques and employ low impact design for parking and staging areas. 
There are several exisƟ  ng industrial sites within 
the City of Birmingham with rail access that are proximate to interstate highways, and have both air and water transport nearby.  These are locaƟ  ons where freight villages might evolve 
and thrive.

The City of Birmingham will use the funding available through the Smart City Challenge to accomplish the following programmaƟ  c goals:
• Enhance Mobility and Access
• Improve Traﬃ   c Safety for All Users
• Reduce Environmental Impacts and 
Support Sustainability
• SƟ mulate Economic Growth
Speciﬁ  c measurable program objecƟ  ves are set 
to monitor progress and demonstrate impacts of planned iniƟ  aƟ ves on mobility, safety, 
climate change, sustainability, and economic growth. Goals and objecƟ  ves are summarized 
in Table xx along with corresponding performance measures. These are in line with programmaƟ  c goals set forward by the

12technologies and iniƟ  aƟ ves undertaken as part 
of the Smart City Challenge and summarize lessons learned for the beneﬁ  t of other ciƟ  es 
facing similar challenges. Also, remaining technical, insƟ  tuƟ onal, and policy challenges 
related to deployment of systems that support Smart City prioriƟ  es will be idenƟ  ﬁ ed and 
countermeasures to address them will be presented.
Our Approach
Building on our current assets and strategic plans for moving Birmingham forward, we intend to use the Smart City Challenge funding to introduce smart, technology-driven transportaƟ  on improvements that will address 
current transportaƟ  on challenges idenƟ  ﬁ ed 
within a city and provide equitable, high quality transportaƟ  on opƟ  ons and services 
to fulﬁ  ll the needs of the traveling public and 
transportaƟ  on industries.
The City’s vision for its transformaƟ  on into a 
Smart City is inclusive of many of the elements of the USDOT’s deﬁ  niƟ on of a smart city.  As 
such, several Smart City transportaƟ  on systems 
improvements and innovaƟ  ons which are 
envisioned to be employed in Birmingham are closely linked with USDOT’s vision elements of a successful Smart City. Examples include the following: 
• Connected Vehicles . The City of 
Birmingham plans to uƟ  lize funds from 
the Smart City Challenge to instrument its infrastructure to meet the transportaƟ  on 
mobility needs of the future.  Two-way short-to- medium-range wireless communicaƟ  ons capability is an important 
ﬁ rst step in this direcƟ  on. The City will use 
Dedicat ed Short Range Communi caƟ ons 
(DSRC) technology to enable informaƟ  on 
sharing among instrumented vehicles (V2V) and between instrumented vehicles 
and infrastructure (V2I) which is crucial for allowing tesƟ  ng and adopƟ  on of 
connected vehicles. Furthermore, the City will work with the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham -- the Birmingham region’s metropolitan planning organizaƟ  on and Central Alabama’s 
regional transportaƟ  on organizaƟ  on, the 
Alabama Department of TransportaƟ  on, 
and communicaƟ  ons providers to integrate 
various communicaƟ  ons plaƞ  orms that are 
enabled by either DSRC or other available networks in support of connected vehicles deployment.  This includes communicaƟ  ons 
technology such as cellular, Wi-Fi, or satellite.  Those communicaƟ  ons remove 
exisƟ  ng barriers through the promoƟ  on of 
shared transportaƟ  on processes, shared 
resources, and common rules of operaƟ  on.
Assuming the maturity of naƟ  onal research 
and development eﬀ  orts in the area of 
connected vehicles in the near future, the City of Birmingham will acƟ  vely seek 
opportuniƟ  es to parƟ  cipate in pilot tesƟ  ng 
 Become America’s Next Smart City
13of connected vehicle concepts. As an early 
adopter of connected vehicles the City of Birmingham will validate its designaƟ  on 
as Smart City and will play an important role in connected vehicles evaluaƟ  on 
and technology transfer iniƟ  aƟ ves. The 
City also will work with BJCTA to explore opportuniƟ  es for instrumentaƟ  on of transit 
buses so that they can become part of the 
connected vehicles program.
Working closely with experts at the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham, the City will develop and implement a comprehensive plan for assessing impacts of connected vehicles deployment on congesƟ  on, traﬃ   c safety, fuel consumpƟ  on, 
air quality, and user saƟ  sfacƟ  on. 
Technology transfer, training, and outreach will provide evidence of the impacts of connected vehicles on mobility, safety, and the environment and will facilitate enhanced adopƟ  on and deployment of 
connected vehicles in other medium size ciƟ es in the future.
• Automated Transit Networks . The City of 
Birmingham understands the importance of urban automaƟ  on and plans to work 
closely with researcher partners at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the automoƟ  ve industry to remove 
insƟ tuƟ onal barriers and address new 
technical and policy challenges associated with vehicle automaƟ  on. The City of 
Birmingham is interested in pursuing the development and tesƟ  ng of an Automated 
Transit Network, more commonly known as Personal Rapid Transit (PRT).  PRT is probably best described as a hybrid between the private car and public transit. In concept, PRT vehicles could hold up to four people or fewer, mimicking the private, quiet ride of a car. RelaƟ  ve to 
exisƟ  ng transportaƟ  on alternaƟ  ves, 
there would be very liƩ  le emissions, no 
traﬃ  c congesƟ  on, no loud noises, and no oﬀ ensive odors produced by PRTs. PRT 
could eﬀ  ecƟ vely supplement Birmingham’s 
soon to be constructed bus rapid transit system, and encourage car-free development by providing desƟ  naƟ on-to-
desƟ naƟ on service with minimal walking to 
and from staƟ  ons. 
PRT is envisioned to be an important 
part of Birmingham’s ShuƩ  lesworth 
InternaƟ  onal Airport’s conƟ  nued evoluƟ  on, 
providing criƟ  cal connecƟ  ons between the 
airport terminal and its soon to be built consolidated rental car facility, proposed oﬃ  ce and light industrial development 
on adjacent properƟ  es, and hotel and 
conference space, and at the Uptown development lo cated a t the edge of 
downtown Birmingham.
• Intelligent, Sensor-Based Infrastructure . 
As a Smart City, the City of Birmingham realizes the importance of installing sensors on the transportaƟ  on network to 
monitor traﬃ   c condiƟ  ons, opƟ  mize signal 
Ɵ mings, support incident management, 
and facilitate informed decisions on mode choice, given real Ɵ  me informaƟ  on and 
available opƟ  ons. Birmingham is commiƩ  ed 
to addressing this need and plans to collaborate with the Alabama Department of TransportaƟ  on and experts at UAB to 
develop and implement sensor deployment 
 Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
14plans that meet current and future 
needs of transportaƟ  on infrastructure 
instrumentaƟ  on.
A Smart City requires the use of technology 
to collect, process, and disseminate informaƟ  on thus allowing system managers 
and users to opƟ  mize eﬃ   ciency, safety, and 
conserve resources. The instrumentaƟ  on 
of vehicles, roadways, and other infrastructure with sensors, as well as the use of supporƟ  ng resources (such as video 
monitoring, tracking of GPS data from tags or mobile phone signals, smart fare cards) to monitor traﬃ   c condiƟ  ons and track 
the movement of vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists in real Ɵ  me are all essenƟ  al 
ingredients for the delivery of a successful, integrated transportaƟ  on program that 
provides eﬃ   ciency 
and choice as part of a Smart City 
paradigm. 
DSRC wireless 
communicaƟ  ons, 
GPS, and vehicles sensors are needed to enable the exchange of informaƟ  on among 
connected vehicles and between instrumented vehicles and the infrastructure.  Smart phone apps allow users to get real Ɵ  me informaƟ  on about transit 
schedules, car-sharing opƟ  ons, bike-
sharing locaƟ  ons, and parking availability.  
AddiƟ  onally, smart sensors can be used 
to monitor conƟ  nuously the condiƟ  ons 
of transportaƟ  on network assets in order 
to opƟ  mize resources used for operaƟ  on 
and maintenance. Moreover, availability of robust data can help tremendously the City of Birmingham in its eﬀ  orts to prioriƟ  ze 
needs and make smart investment 
decisions in the future. 
Sensors may be also needed in buildings 
and other infrastructure elements to monitor their condiƟ  on, manage water use 
and wastewater, or for smart-grid energy transmission. For example, electrochemical sensors can be used to determine the vapors emanaƟ  ng from organic pollutants 
during rain events in storm drains and detect the chemical composiƟ  on of the 
contaminants. The chemical sensors can then be used to idenƟ  fy locaƟ  ons most 
sensiƟ  ve to polluƟ  on during rain events, 
which ulƟ  mately discharge untreated 
into receiving waters (such as rivers and streams). The City of Birmingham will work 
closely with local uƟ liƟ es companies to 
leverage resources from the Smart City Challenge program in order to introduce sensor instrumentaƟ  on 
on the Birmingham testbed. In addiƟ  on 
to using sensors as part of an intelligent infrastructure, Birmingham will explore the use of interacƟ  ve 
technologies, such as crowd-sourcing, to get informaƟ  on about 
ciƟ zens’ needs and preferences, which will 
help decision makers to address key issues aﬀ ecƟ ng the public as part of the Smart 
City program.
Some challenges sƟ  ll remain related to data 
fusion, integraƟ  on, and storage of the vast 
amounts of data expected to be generated within a Smart City context. The City of 
 Become America’s Next Smart City
15Birmingham will rely on the experƟ  se of 
faculty at UAB to develop and employ appropriate data mining techniques that will assist greatly to interpret and use the data in eﬃ   cient and creaƟ  ve ways for the 
beneﬁ  t of the public.
• Urban AnalyƟ  cs. The mulƟ  -modal 
transportaƟ  on system envisioned for 
Birmingham will be driven by data. Data will allow system planning that truly reﬂ ects demand and community needs. 
The operaƟ  on and eﬀ  ecƟ veness of the 
transportaƟ  on system will be conƟ  nuously 
monitored in real-Ɵ  me, ensuring that 
community needs are being met regardless of condiƟ  ons. Data gathered from a variety 
of sources will allow the integraƟ  on of 
mobility with broader goals of community health and economic vitality. All of this will rely on the collecƟ  on of data from mulƟ  ple 
(and someƟ  mes seemingly disparate) 
sources, synthesis and analysis at a data center, and its provision to all stakeholders in a Ɵ  mely and easily accessible format. 
TransportaƟ  on data will be at the core, 
but data related to community health, economics, energy, and resiliency will be integrated as well to ensure that all members of the community are being served. 
TransportaƟ  on system monitoring has 
tradiƟ  onally been diﬃ   cult for medium sized 
ciƟ es like Birmingham. Unable to aﬀ  ord 
the extensive detector and monitoring systems found in many larger ciƟ  es, data 
collecƟ  on has oŌ  en depended on very 
limited sampling eﬀ  orts.  Fortunately, the 
foundaƟ  on for data analyƟ  cs is already 
in place in Birmingham. The Regional Planning Commission and UAB established the Regional TransportaƟ  on Data Center 
in 2009, a partnership which monitors the performance of the regional transportaƟ  on 
system and makes data and analysis available to stakeholders. Currently the Center focuses on collecƟ  ng and analyzing 
historical travel data such as counts, vehicle speeds, travel Ɵ  mes, transit usage, and 
incident reports. The data are used to monitor congesƟ  on trends, idenƟ  fy hot-
spots for congesƟ  on and incidents, and 
prioriƟ  ze transportaƟ  on projects. The data 
are also used to evaluate the eﬀ  ecƟ veness 
of transportaƟ  on improvement projects. 
But this is just scratching the surface of what the Center will be as the Birmingham vision moves forward. The Center has recently begun to incorporate more mulƟ  -modal data for transit, bicycles, and 
pedestrians. Freight will also have growing importance, as Birmingham serves as a link between the Piedmont-AtlanƟ  c and Gulf 
Coast mega-regions. 
To tackle the extensive analyƟ  cs that will 
be required in the future, UAB has brought their Big Data AnalyƟ  cs Lab into the eﬀ  ort. 
The lab, which originates in the Electrical Engineering Department, provides big data experƟ  se across the UAB medical and 
research centers and is pursuing cuƫ   ng-
edge research with industrial collaborators. By combining data from mulƟ  ple sources 
in novel ways, Birmingham will be able to develop a mulƟ  -modal transportaƟ  on 
system that truly supports the vision of personal mobility, community health, and economic vitality.
• Smart Cards . The City of Birmingham 
envisions that access to all of the transportaƟ  on services -- transit, bikeshare, 
parking -- will be seamless. Currently, 
 Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
16the region’s transportaƟ  on providers all 
provide access to their services using diﬀ erent payment mediums. Public transit 
in Birmingham uƟ  lizes, cash, paper passes, 
and Ɵ  cket books.  Zyp Bikeshare users 
access bikes at kiosks using either a credit card or a pre-paid key fob.  They also can use their smart phones via the Zyp Bikeshare app.  Drivers accessing on-street parking and the City’s public structured parking faciliƟ  es use loose change and cash 
respecƟ  vely.
Smart cards, as envisioned for Birmingham, 
will employ new technology currently being deployed by the naƟ  on’s banks to provide 
travelers with a more secure payment system that is universally accepted, is ﬂ exible in its design, enables travelers 
to beƩ  er budget for transportaƟ  on, and 
allows access to travel across mulƟ  ple 
transportaƟ  on modes. Frequent use also 
will enable travelers to beƩ  er track their 
use of the transportaƟ  on system, as well 
as agencies to beƩ  er understand how 
the system is being used.  Finally, the technology will aid agencies to cut down on operaƟ  ng costs by eliminaƟ  ng the need 
to manage mulƟ  ple payment mediums 
and reducing the risk posed by fraud by physically collecƟ  ng money.
• Smart Land Use . The City of Birmingham 
has embraced its new urban future.  The Birmingham Comprehensive Plan (Comprehensive Plan), draŌ  ed in 2012 and 
adopted in October 2013, lays out a criƟ  cal 
foundaƟ  on for the achievement of a more 
vibrant and sustainable city and region. The Comprehensive Plan establishes an inclusive vision for revitalizaƟ  on. It 
oﬀ ers an exhausƟ  ve list of strategies for 
encouraging and aƩ  racƟ  ng community 
reinvestment, as well as ideas for how to develop healthy neighborhoods. This includes recommendaƟ  ons for a variety of housing choices accessible across a 
range of incomes, age, and ability as well as infrastructure recommendaƟ  ons for 
complete streets, and policies to minimize health dispariƟ  es.
Public and private investments in 
places and public ameniƟ  es such as the 
Woodlawn and Avondale neighborhoods, the Lakeview and Parkside districts, Railroad Park, Region’s Field, and the Birmingham Crossplex are all examples of the integrated, holisƟ  c approach 
that the City is taking to address the complex challenges it faces. The subsequent Framework Plans, district level comprehensive planning documents that build oﬀ   of the Comprehensive Plan, are 
the City’s primary policy tool for achieving its vision to be a City of Smart Places. The Framework Plans provide greater clarity, detail, and direcƟ  on for land use, land 
development, transportaƟ  on, housing, 
acƟ ve and passive greenspace i.e. parks, 
trails and open space, uƟ  liƟ es and 
economic development.
The concept of Smart Places revolves 
 Become America’s Next Smart City
17around the City’s vision for its communiƟ  es 
and neighborhoods to be beƩ  er connected 
to services and opportuniƟ  es, to be 
more walkable and bicycle-friendly, to oﬀ er a range of housing choices that 
are aﬀ  ordable to all, to be supporƟ  ve of 
neighborhood scaled businesses as well as the larger urban economy, and to provide safe and healthy environments for its residents. To that end, City through its development of its mass transit services and parƟ  cularly the BRT system, will 
establish a system of connected mobility hubs. Mobility hubs were previously described in Our Vision for Birmingham as a Smart City.
• Strategic Business Models and Partnering OpportuniƟ  es. The City of Birmingham 
will collaborate very closely with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and uƟ  lize experƟ  se and technical 
capabiliƟ  es of faculty members at UAB 
to plan, design, implement, and evaluate iniƟ aƟ ves undertaken as part of the Smart 
City Challenge program. A collaboraƟ  on 
agreement between UAB and the City of Birmingham was signed in February 2013 and marked the beginning of this successful partnership which serves as a solid foundaƟ  on for the Smart City Challenge 
program. 
Through the UAB Sustainable Smart 
CiƟ es Research Center (SSCRC), UAB has 
an already established role as an engine of innovaƟ  on that can transform the 
community through the use of smart technologies and informaƟ  on systems, 
eﬀ ecƟ ve transportaƟ  on alternaƟ  ves, 
renewable energy opƟ  ons, and sustainable 
environment soluƟ  ons. The partnership 
between UAB Sustainable Smart CiƟ  es 
Research Center (UAB SSC) and the City of Birmingham creates excellent research, educaƟ  on, and training collaboraƟ  on 
opportuniƟ  es within a unique seƫ   ng where the city becomes a living laboratory 
for implementaƟ  on and tesƟ  ng of 
innovaƟ  ve research applicaƟ  on to beneﬁ  t 
the community.
Moreover, UAB is a University partner of 
the Southeast TransportaƟ  on Research, 
InnovaƟ  on and EducaƟ  on Center (STRIDE) 
a Regional University TransportaƟ  on 
Center (UTC) led by the University of Florida. STRIDE University partners devote their energies to three major focal areas: transportaƟ  on safety, livable communiƟ  es, 
and economic compeƟ  Ɵ veness which are 
directly related to Smart City Challenge program prioriƟ  es. UAB is also a member 
of the NaƟ  onal Center for TransportaƟ  on 
System ProducƟ  vity and Management 
(NCTSPM), a Tier 1 NaƟ  onal University 
TransportaƟ  on Center led by the Georgia 
InsƟ tute of Technology. 
 The well-established partnership 
between the City of Birmingham, UAB’s Sustainable Smart CiƟ  es Research Center, 
and the STRIDE and NCTSPM University TransportaƟ  on Centers as part of the Smart 
City Challenge will foster cross-disciplinary research, training, and outreach that will promote the development of innovaƟ  ve 
soluƟ  ons for sustainable smart ciƟ  es and 
communiƟ  es and disseminaƟ  on of ﬁ  ndings 
for the beneﬁ  t of transportaƟ  on agencies, 
professionals, and the public at large.
UAB’s commitment to economic 
development is also aligned with regional and state strategies, including “Blueprint Birmingham” — the community’s growth strategy led by Birmingham Business Alliance — and Accelerate Alabama, which seeks to drive recruitment of new projects, business retenƟ  on and develop home-
grown start-ups.
Figure 1 provides a graphic illustraƟ  on of the

18many of these Smart City concepts are desired.
It should be noted that this document only presents a high-level vision for the Birmingham’s proposed Smart City technology deployment. A detailed technical and management approach for realizing the aforemenƟ  oned vision, along with speciﬁ  cs 
about the implementaƟ  on requirements 
and the metrics to be used for quanƟ  ﬁ caƟ on 
and evaluaƟ  on of impacts associated with 
deployment and operaƟ  ons are outside the 
scope of the current solicitaƟ  on.

UAB Bill L. HarbertInsƟ tute for InnovaƟ  on and Entrepreneurship  
UAB’s InsƟ  tute for InnovaƟ  on and 
Entrepreneurship (IIE) improves the eﬃ   ciency 
and compeƟ  Ɵ veness of its research engine 
in an environment that fuels and sustains innovaƟ  on among faculty, researchers, 
students and community leaders. IIE helps to accelerate new company formaƟ  on and 
technology transfer through improved and ﬂ exible processes that build on successes of 
the UAB Research FoundaƟ  on (UABRF).  Since 
its incepƟ  on, UABRF has generated more than 
$64 million in licensing revenues and helped created 55 start-up companies based on products and technologies discovered at UAB.  IIE is bolstered by the InvenƟ  on-to-InnovaƟ  on 
(i2i) program. i2i is a joint eﬀ  ort by the School 
of Business, UAB Research FoundaƟ  on and 
Birmingham Business Alliance to market UAB assets with high commercial potenƟ  al.
InnovaƟ  on Depot
Opened in 2007, InnovaƟ  on Depot is an 
incubator and economic development program that hosts a shared co-work space facility in what was an abandoned Sears department store in the City’s Entrepreneurial Center just west of the city center. It is the Southeast’s premier technology business incubator, and is at the heart of Birmingham’s newly designated Eco-District. 
InnovaƟ  on Depot also host UAB’s Oﬃ   ce for 
the Advancement of Developing Industries. The 145,000 square foot space is designed to accommodate as many as 75 small businesses and up to 500 workers. However, demand has been high and there are currently 92 companies employing 540 people working under the InnovaƟ  on Depot banner. , In 
partnership with the City of Birmingham, InnovaƟ  on Depot conƟ  nues to work to support 
early stage technology companies, and has seen those it’s taken under its wing stay local. About 90% of the companies that go through the program stay close to home when they  Become America’s Next Smart City

include companies such as RFID and Motus, a motorcycle company that employs an in-house designed and patented V-4 engine. The engine that Motus designed and developed the world’s ﬁ  rst direct-inject, liquid cooled V-4 
engine.  The company now manufactures from a facility in downtown Birmingham.
Workforce Readiness
The City of Birmingham has long been commiƩ  ed to workforce development and 
training.  Lawson State Community College is locat ed in the City of Birmingham, and is 
accessible by public transit.  Considered to be a historically black college and university (HBCU), Lawson State is a parƟ  cipaƟ  ng member of the 
Alabama Center for AutomoƟ  ve Excellence, 
and oﬀ  ers three auto mechanics programs 
sponsored by manufacturers - Ford ASSET, GM ASEP and Toyota T-TEN. These programs are designed to helps address the demand for skilled automoƟ  ve technicians, and reduce the 
talent gap between jobs posted and available workers to ﬁ  ll them. Ranked among the top 
50 best community colleges in the country, and consistently ranked in the top 5 of this group, Lawson State Community College also is one of the NaƟ  onal AlternaƟ  ve Fuels Training 
ConsorƟ  um (NAFTC) aﬃ   liated NaƟ  onal Training 
Centers.  NAFTC includes a naƟ  onal network 
of NaƟ  onal Training Centers which are post-
secondary educaƟ  on and training organizaƟ  ons 
that provide vehicle instrucƟ  on and a 
demonstrated commitment to move towards providing instrucƟ  on in alternaƟ  ve fuels, 
alternaƟ  ve fueled vehicles (AFVs), advanced 
technology vehicles, and related technologies. Since 2009, Lawson State has been training mechanics speciﬁ  cally 
in the care and repair of AFV’s and advanced technology 
vehicles to include electric vehicles.  Lawson State also is a top supplier of skilled labor to Alabama’s automoƟ  ve industry, and graduates 
have found gainful employment with Mercedes Benz U.S.A., Hyundai America, Toyota, and Nissan.
In 2011, Lawson State Community College 
was recognized by the Obama AdministraƟ  on 
as a Champion of Change for its work with developing the next generaƟ  on of skilled labor 
and providing a successful bridge between vocaƟ  onal and academic educaƟ  on. 
Lawson State Community College’s Birmingham 
campus will link directly with the Birmingham BRT, host a mobility hub, and connect to other area mobility hub(s) that are currently being planned as part of the City’s comprehensive planning process. It’s Bessemer campus will link with the BRT corridor as it expands west in future phases.
In addiƟ  on to training mechanics, there is a 
statewide push to by the Alabama Technology Network, the Alabama Industrial Development Training, and community colleges are trying to accelerate teaching speciﬁ  c technical 
skills. This includes teaching computer coding skills. Code.org, is naƟ  onal organizaƟ  on 
focused on increasing access to computer science educaƟ  on. Code.org is partnering 
with A+ College Ready and the Alabama State Department of EducaƟ  on, and will invest 
$500,000 to build on Alabama’s eﬀ  orts to 
expand computer science courses in K-12 classrooms across the state. The investment will double the number of Alabama teachers 
qualiﬁ  ed and trained to teach 
computer science in the state’s public schools. 
Our Commitment
Leadership. Since becoming 
Mayor of Birmingham in 2010, 
 Become America’s Next Smart City
21William A. Bell, Sr. has steered the City into a 
new and exciƟ  ng direcƟ  on. AŌ  er inheriƟ  ng a 
$77 million budget deﬁ  cit, Mayor Bell quickly 
took control and began transforming the City, bringing about a renaissance of development and culture, and ushering in a new era of economic prosperity.
Under Mayor Bell’s leadership, Birmingham 
has made key strategic investments to spark growth and revitalizaƟ  on. The development of 
a new downtown baseball stadium -- Regions Field-- the Negro Southern League Museum, and conƟ  nued support of Railroad park has 
brought hundreds of millions of dollars of private investment to the thriving Parkside district and returned baseball to the City of Birmingham. Other investments, such as the Birmingham Crossplex, the Uptown Entertainment District, and implementaƟ  on of 
the Red Rock Ridge and Valley Trail System are 
currently spurring residenƟ  al and commercial 
growth in throughout the city.
Numerous corporaƟ  ons have r elocated to 
Birmingham or renewed their commitment to stay in Birmingham. This includes Healthsouth, Steris, Kamtech among others.
In 2013, Mayor Bell signed a memorandum 
of understanding with the University of Alabama at Birmingham Sustainable Smart CiƟ es Research Center to partner on projects 
that would make Birmingham a more livable city. Through this partnership, Birmingham received one of 16  (one of four in the United States) IBM 2014 Smarter CiƟ  es Challenge 
Grants aimed at eliminaƟ  ng food deserts in 
Birmingham.
Mayor Bell is not only changing the face 
of Birmingham locally, he is Birmingham’s ambassador to the world. He has served as president of the African American Mayors AssociaƟ  on (AAMA), co-chairing the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors CommiƩ  ee on Human Rights. He is also co-chair of “My Brothers 
Keeper,” an iniƟ  aƟ ve by the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors and President Barack Obama.
The Sharing 
Economy . The City 
of Birmingham is commiƩ  ed to the 
developing of its sharing economy, and will conƟ  nue 
to integrate transportaƟ  on 
technology soluƟ  ons 
so that they support these highly ﬂ exible economic 
networks.  The City already has made it easier to share resources on demand, supporƟ  ng 
the development of the awarding winning InnovaƟ  on Depot.
The City has supported the development 
of other co-working spaces such as REV Birmingham’s SocialVenture and 55th Place Arts.  SocialVenture is a f acility lo cated in the 
historic Woodlawn neighborhood that oﬀ  ers 
Birmingham’s entrepreneurs, non-proﬁ  ts 
and start-ups shared oﬃ   ce and retail space, 
and a divisible space to house meeƟ  ngs, 
workshops and recepƟ  ons.  55th Place Arts 
oﬀ ers customizable studio workspace for 
arƟ sts, makers, and other creaƟ  ves. All of these 
faciliƟ  es -- InnovaƟ  on Depot, SocialVenture, 
and 55th Place Arts -- are lo cated in proposed 
mobility hub locaƟ  ons. InnovaƟ  on Depot 
already has access to the Zyp Bikeshare program.; the other two locaƟ  ons are 
proposed to have access to Zyp Bikeshare and BRT.
In addiƟ  on to supporƟ  ng co-working space, the 
City of Birmingham also supports the Urban Food Project. The Urban Food Project aims to build a robust local food economy while creaƟ  ng healthy food access. The program 
 Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
22assists corner store owners with shared 
resources that help them to purchase, market, market, and sell of fresh produce. The Urban Food Project addresses Birmingham’s food desert problems by assisƟ  ng Alabama’s farmers 
plan their crops and access underserved markets i.e. Birmingham’s food deserts, providing delivery services of quality produce to neighborhood restaurants and corner stores.
Finally, the City is supporƟ  ve of the sharing 
economy in that rideshare companies such as Uber, and LyŌ  , as well as apartment/
house sharing companies such as Air BnB are all now permiƩ  ed to operate within City 
limits.  Because Birmingham is the largest city in Alabama, its agreement to allow these businesses to operate within the City has opened up the sharing economy’s market to the enƟ  re Central Alabama region.
Our Process
Decision-Makers . A decision structure has 
been established that includes input from each of our key team members. A risk reward matrix will be established to allow the ranking of idenƟ  ﬁ ed components and opƟ  ons for speciﬁ  c 
projects during program implementaƟ  on.  
Each strategy and implementaƟ  on plan will be 
submiƩ  ed to the commiƩ  ee for review and 
ranked against the objecƟ  ve of the Smart CiƟ  es 
Challenge, as well as the available resources for implementaƟ  on.  Key decision factors 
include: a) opƟ  mizaƟ  on of exisƟ  ng assets, b) 
integraƟ  on with other program components, 
c) expandability, d) transferability, and e) the ability to advance Smart CiƟ  es Challenge 
objecƟ  ves speciﬁ  cally for mobility hub. This 
approach will allow for diverse input for selecƟ  on of technologies and approaches that 
best advance the City of Birmingham’s overall Smart CiƟ  es program, and generate outcomes 
with the maximum beneﬁ  t for the City. This 
approach also will idenƟ  fy acƟ  viƟ es that can 
be implemented in other jurisdicƟ  ons and naƟ onwide.
Each team member will idenƟ  fy one 
representaƟ  ve to serve on the commiƩ  ee 
and assist with alternaƟ  ve selecƟ  on. The 
commiƩ  ee will be chaired by the Mayor’s 
oﬃ  ce.
Program Management . The Program 
Management structure for the Smart CiƟ  es 
Challenge program will be put in-place from the iniƟ  al formulaƟ  on of the program’s 
objecƟ  ves, and will be implemented 
conƟ  nuously through the closeout of the 
program.  The Program Management Team will include:
• ndividual Project Management Plans
• Program Scheduling
• Financial Management
• Value Engineering
Our Risks
There are several potenƟ  al technical, policy, 
and insƟ  tuƟ onal risks associated with the 
deployment of the City of Birmingham’s Smart CiƟ es Challenge vision. While the risks are 
many and varied, most all of them might be avoided and miƟ  gated through thoughƞ  ul 
and careful preparaƟ  on, transparency, and 
educaƟ  on.  The decision -making and program 
management structure is designed to address many of the risks idenƟ  ﬁ ed herein. 
Our Systems
TransportaƟ  on Infrastructure . As of May, 
2014, the Birmingham metropolitan planning area’s funcƟ  onally classiﬁ  ed roadways were 
comprised of: Become America’s Next Smart City
23Transit Services . IFixed route and paratransit 
services are provided to the City of Birmingham by the Birmingham Jeﬀ  erson 
County Transit Authority (BJCTA). BJCTA operates 35 routes consisƟ  ng of a) 29 ﬁ  xed 
route marketed as MAX, b) one express route, c) two neighborhood circulators, d) one specialty shuƩ  le servicing the Birmingham-
ShuƩ  lesworth InternaƟ  onal Airport, and e) two 
downtown circulator routes.  All ﬁ  xed-route 
and paratransit services operate Monday through Friday between 4am and 11:30pm, and on Saturdays between 4am and midnight.  No services are provided on Sunday.
Shared Use Mobility Services . Several shared-
use mobility services are currently available in the City of Birmingham. Examples include Zyp Bikeshare, car sharing, CommuteSmart, and Commercial Shared Ride Services. Details about those services are available in “Our 
Vision”.
InformaƟ  on and CommunicaƟ  on Technology
The City of Birmingham is in the process of upgrading all its IT infrastructure that adhere to security guidelines and allows for a more robust and secure network plaƞ  orm. The 
City has already deployed VoIP (voice over internet protocol) communicaƟ  ons across the 
board with integrated uniﬁ  ed communicaƟ  ons 
systems.  Several ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems are already in place speciﬁ  c 
to ﬁ nance, public safety (police, ﬁ  re, courts), 
human resources, document imaging, body cameras for police personnel, and the ESRI GIS mapping system which integrates with our other ERP systems.
The City of Birmingham has already completed 
the required infrastructure, including the ﬁ  ber 
opƟ cs layout, to support NG 911 systems.  The

24City also has a built a traﬃ   c control center to 
maintain and monitor (24X7) more than 700 traﬃ  c intersecƟ  ons.
The City recently updated its web presence, 
incorporaƟ  ng a majority of “eServices” 
including: online business tax payment, parking Ɵ cket and traﬃ   c ﬁ ne payment, food truck 
vendor applicaƟ  on, etc.  An associated web 
app has been developed as well.  The City of Birmingham has also developed a public service web portal that will be launched in the near future.
Finally, the City of Birmingham is considering a 
GIG (gigabit) ﬁ  ber network “self-healing” ring 
deployment to the City as a whole that will provide high bandwidth internet connecƟ  vity 
to all City businesses and the public as well.
Intelligent TransportaƟ  on Systems . The City 
of Birmingham operates a Traﬃ   c Management 
Center (TMC) which is uƟ  lizing CCTV cameras 
to monitor traﬃ   c condiƟ  ons and control traﬃ   c 
signal intersecƟ  ons remotely in response to 
recurrent and non-recurrent congesƟ  on.  The 
TMC was updated in 2012 to include a new video wall, Ethernet switch, video management soŌ ware, work staƟ  ons, encoders, Ɵ  me servers 
and video wall servers.  This center is designed and set up to manage copper and ﬁ  ber cable 
plants.  It is the City of Birmingham’s goal to work in a mulƟ  agency/mulƟ  jurisdicƟ  onal 
manner so that the TMC’s reach might extend beyond the City’s boundaries, and aid with monitoring and collecƟ  ng informaƟ  on about the enƟ  re transportaƟ  on system using its 
network of sensors, cameras, and other technology.
ITS Architecture and Data Standards . 
Intelligent TransportaƟ  on Syst ems (ITS) present 
stakeholders with a variety of opƟ  ons in order 
to address a variety of transportaƟ  on needs. 
The framework provided by the NaƟ  onal ITS 
Architecture makes system, product, and service compaƟ  bility possible, without limiƟ  ng 
the design opƟ  ons of the stakeholder. As 
connected and automated vehicles emerge, expansion of the NaƟ  onal ITS Architecture 
and Standards is needed to provide the necessary guidance so that stakeholders develop systems soluƟ  ons that are compaƟ  ble 
in order to share data, provide coordinated, area-wide integrated operaƟ  ons; and support 
interoperable equipment and services where appropriate. The Connected Vehicle Reference ImplementaƟ  on (CVRIA) was developed to 
address this need.
As a Smart City, the City of Birmingham 
is commiƩ  ed to using the NaƟ  onal ITS 
Architecture and Standards as well as CVRIA guidelines to deﬁ  ne operaƟ  onal, user, Table 4. Birmingham Roadway System DescripƟ  on

25performance, and program requirements 
for the deployment of ITS technologies and connected/automated vehicle technologies as part of the implementaƟ  on process. 
Furthermore, the research team will document any exisƟ  ng gaps with respect to 
the use of currently available architecture, standards, and protocols in an eﬀ  ort to inform 
USDOT and standard seƫ   ng organizaƟ  ons 
about further needs for reﬁ  nement or 
development of new standards to support the adopƟ  on of interoperable architectures and 
integrated, fully open systems.
Our Data
Data Availability . To date, most of the data 
collected by the City has been historical travel data used for forecasƟ  ng and 
planning purposes. For the roadway system, Birmingham currently collects traﬃ   c counts, 
travel speed data, travel Ɵ  me data, and 
informaƟ  on on incidents and crashes. For 
transit, the City collects ridership data. For pedestrians and bicycles, the City has begun an eﬀ  ort to collect data on these modes 
through pedestrian facility counts. Automated data from the Zyp Bikeshare program is also now available and providing useful data on biking paƩ  erns in the City. Data are currently 
analyzed and warehoused at the Regional TransportaƟ  on Data Center, a partnership 
between the Regional Planning Commission and UAB.
 Data CollecƟ  on. The City will conƟ  nue its 
current data collecƟ  on eﬀ  orts in the future, 
but the goal as Birmingham moves forward will be to focus on:
• CollecƟ  ng more data from mulƟ  ple modes 
and sources
• IntegraƟ  ng data from other databases 
(e.g., medical, geospaƟ  al)
• CollecƟ  ng and analyzing data in real-Ɵ  me
• CollecƟ  ng data more eﬃ   ciently by using personal technologies and the smart city 
infrastructure to automate data collecƟ  on
• DistribuƟ  ng data and analysis in real-Ɵ  me 
to ciƟ  zens and stakeholder
These addiƟ  onal data will allow the City to 
beƩ er monitor the complete transportaƟ  on 
system in real Ɵ  me and shiŌ   resources as 
needed to accommodate changing demand or condiƟ  ons. This will require real-Ɵ  me data 
analyƟ  cs and distribuƟ  on, something for w 
hich the Data Center is beginning to plan.
Data Warehousing . Data will conƟ  nue to be 
stored, analyzed, and distributed from the Regional TransportaƟ  on Data Center. The 
addiƟ  on of the UAB Big Data AnalyƟ  cs Lab as a 
partner will enhance this eﬀ  ort.
Data Sharing . Because of the proprietary 
nature of so much transportaƟ  on data, 
sharing of data has been diﬃ   cult in the 
past.  Travel Ɵ  me data provided by the U.S. 
government, for example, cannot be easily shared with outside enƟ  Ɵ es due to ownership 
agreements. Similarly, freight data are considered proprietary by private carriers, who are reluctant to release any data related to actual types of freight moved. Even greater barriers exist with community health data, where personal privacy is paramount. One of the iniƟ  al, and potenƟ  ally most diﬃ   cult, tasks 
for the data center moving forward will be to assess these data sharing hurdles and idenƟ  fy 
the most eﬀ  ecƟ ve ways to resolve them. This 
will be no small eﬀ  ort, but will be essenƟ  al to 
future success.  The goal is to make data and analyƟ  cs available to local stakeholders in real-
Ɵ me.
The City of Birmingham is commiƩ  ed to 
publishing datasets online, in easy-to-use formats that can be analyzed, used and republished as needed.  An example is aggregated traﬃ   c accident data which includes 
locaƟ  on and Ɵ  me of day.  Currently, the City  Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
26is in discussion with the Code for Birmingham 
brigade regarding the establishment of an open data policy.
Data IntegraƟ  on. Data integraƟ  on will be 
performed with the support of the UAB Big Data AnalyƟ  cs Lab. With data anƟ  cipated from 
a wide variety of sources (highway, transit, freight, bicycle, medical, personal devices, and smart city infrastructure), integraƟ  on 
and analysis will require the development of protocols with the city and key stakeholders.
Our Influence
Through the Birmingham BRT, improved public transportaƟ  on services, Complete Streets, and 
pedestrian networks funding received from the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge will assist lower 
income residents climb the economic ladder to beƩ er long-term opportuniƟ  es for themselves, 
their families, and their neighborhoods.  The City of Birmingham intends to leverage the resources provided through the TIGER VII grants to catalyze reinvestment in the City’s neighborhoods, and redevelopment along the BRT corridor.
In addiƟ  on to the TIGER funding, the City 
of Birmingham has worked successfully with the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham (RPCGB), the metropolitan planning organizaƟ  on (MPO) 
for the Birmingham metropolitan area, leveraging federal funds for sidewalks, trails, roadways, and intelligent transportaƟ  on 
system (ITS) infrastructure.  The City’s work with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on the rebuilding of the PraƩ   Community following the April 
2011 tornadoes and the U.S. Environmental ProtecƟ  on Agency (U.S. EPA) in remediaƟ  ng 
the North Birmingham superfund site also are examples of how the City of Birmingham has leveraged federal funds.
The City of Birmingham also has a successful track record when it comes to leveraging 
private resources.  The construcƟ  on of Region’s 
Field and the Railroad Park in downtown saw the City working in partnership with the local business and development community to raise funds to construct these faciliƟ  es 
that in turn catalyzed the redevelopment of a once industrial area into a thriving enclave of young professionals, innovaƟ  ve businesses 
and entrepreneurs. Likewise, working with local non-proﬁ  t organizaƟ  ons such as the 
Woodlawn FoundaƟ  on, the City’s Woodlawn 
Neighborhood has transformed itself from one of the City’s worst areas into one of its most desirable.
Birmingham has successfully leveraged 
funding using such economic development tools and the Tax Increment Finance (TIF) districts and Capital Improvement CooperaƟ  ve 
Districts (CICD) to fund criƟ  cal infrastructure 
development and repairs.  The City is planning to use these tools to assist with revitalizaƟ  on 
eﬀ orts in the BRT corridor and at the BRT 
staƟ ons which are also the mobility hubs 
idenƟ  ﬁ ed in the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge vision.
The City of Birmingham and the State of 
Alabama are home to several ﬁ  nancial 
insƟ tuƟ ons that have both a naƟ  onal and 
internaƟ  onal footprint. These insƟ  tuƟ ons have 
a strong track record of providing philanthropic support and civic contribuƟ  ons that are 
helping to improve the overall quality of life for residents.
Finally, The University of Alabama at 
Birmingham which is a partner in this endeavor is commiƩ  ed to leveraging its relaƟ  onship with 
its research network and other local academic insƟ tuƟ ons to leverage their collecƟ  ve 
resources with private industry, parƟ  cularly 
within the State’s automoƟ  ve manufacturing 
industry to research and deploy Smart CiƟ  es 
technology and strategies."	rise rise meet challengebecome americas next icontents introduction challenge opportunity vision goal approach capa commitment process risks data influence lettersupport

 1. SMART CITY VISION  
Smart Cities are at the  forefront of the nation’s mind  right now, and we have seen an enormous surge in the 
discussions about the possibilities and benefits of Smart Cities. While there are many similar definitions of 
the concept in circulation, one that summarizes many of the elements required to make a city  or region 
connected and “smart” is:  
“A city that uses information and communications technology to enhance its livability, 
workability, and sustainability.”  —The Smart Cities Council  
 
Kansas City, Missouri has truly reinvented itself over the past deca de, and now boasts a thriving technical / 
innovation economic sector, vibrant culinary and performing arts scenes, the historic 18th and Vine district, 
our renowned parks and boulevard system and, of course, the World Champion Kansas City Royals. These 
attributes are not all that define Kansas City. In recent years, we have experienced city -wide revitalization 
due to significant infrastructure improvements including a downtown streetcar, one of the bi ggest  smart city 
investments in  America, and the growth of start-up businesses and commercial businesses as a result. 
Flyover city no more, Kansas City is the cent er of the American renaissance.  We are the model city to look 
to for ideas on how to fight crime, get kids reading on grade level, s upport small entrepreneurs, narrow the 
digital divide, innovate government processes , and grow the economy in all the right ways.   
 
Cities are at the forefront of change, influencing 
and touching citizens’ daily lives in a myriad of 
ways.  Transportation is at the heart of it all, driving 
citizen access to other  quality of life amenities. As 
technology evolves, so too must cities and the 
transportation infrastructure that weaves a city 
together. Kansas City, with a population of 
459,787, is an ideally sized city to implement next -
generation technology in mature a nd evolving 
neighborhoods.  A smart city is not defined 
exclusively by technology; rather, it is defined by 
the way a city eases the lives of its citizens and 
provides essential services in the most efficient 
manner possible. From a city perspective, 
trans portation is among the most essential 
services. Cars are not merely machines, but the 
means by which a family goes from their home to their schools, to their places of employment, to their doctors’ 
offices, to visit their parents, and then back home again.  In an urban core surrounded by rural communities, 
the synchronized interaction of busses, streetcars, bicycles, walking paths and freight operations enable 
citizens to live their lives. In this vein, cities must make transportation safer, easily accessibl e, more efficient, 
and user friendly by using advanced technologies that protect our environment.  
 
Kansas City, MO is doing just that.  Building upon our existing smart city infrastructure and open data systems, 
expansive highway and roadway system, existi ng placemaking and digital inclusion efforts, our vision focuses 
on using technology and establishing metrics that will directly impact neighborhoods. We will begin in those 
that need impactful infrastructure improvements the most. Neighborhoods east of Tr oost, a street that has 
historically divided socioeconomic classes in our city (i.e. the “East Side”), especially need these investments. 
The existing Smart + Connected City initiative is 
being driven by a partnership with Cisco, Sprint, 
and others to enhance internet availability, 
energy savings, new revenue streams, and 
improve connectivity with citizens, including 
efforts to bridge the “digital divide.” The initiative 
will attract technology startups from across the 
globe to test their conc epts here as KCMO 
becomes an open data “Living Lab.” The changes 
are happening first along the 2.2 -mile downtown 
streetcar line and will change the way the city 
works – from more efficient management of 
infrastructure like traffic signals, streetlights, an d 
storm water systems to new ways to engage with 
residents and visitors.  
  City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  2 | P a g e  
 Unemployment, poverty, and crime rates are disproportionately higher in this area. The Beyond Traffic grant 
would prov ide a means for these neighborhoods to access WiFi and the Internet, develop better cost/time 
efficient transportation, and increase economic development.  As a result, Kansas Citians will get to their jobs 
faster, easier and more cheaply. Residents will h ave greater access to educational, employment, dietary and 
health care opportunities, and citizens will live in safer, cleaner and better connected communities.  
 
Kansas City is implementing cutting edge smart cities technologies and preparing for what’s ne xt. 
Autonomous vehicles, currently designated as the “car of tomorrow,” will be better positioned in a city that is 
preparing for it today. Three important factors directly support these efforts:  
(1) Kansas City has 319 square miles within its boundaries and almost 8,000 square miles in the 
metropolitan area; we maintain the most highway miles in the region and manage the interstate system from 
the Colorado/Kansas border to the  outskirts of Saint Louis   
(2) Kansas City has the most established infrastructu re of fiber and WiFi in the United States; we 
were the first Google Fiber city and were recently lauded by HUD Secretary Castro  
(3) Kansas City hosts two major car manufacturing facilities; we are a conveniently located test bed 
for automobile industry R& D activities.  
 
Finally, it is important that we continue to make our current transportation as connected and robust as 
possible. We propose several initiatives that enhance our recent investments, including better use of bike 
sharing through road diets, an d an app for Kansas City residents and visitors to provide clear and simple 
wayfinding. Our approach combines new technology (i.e. connected / autonomous vehicles, and smart city 
sensors) with existing transportation infrastructure, and it results in a sys tem that generates a positive impact 
much greater than the sum of its parts.  
 
Kansas City will meet the Smart City Challenge with three interconnected efforts, which we refer to as our 
“pillars.” These pillars will enable us to develop, validate, and depl oy elements of a 22nd Century 
transportation system that can evolve as technologies continue to develop. The three pillars include:  
1)  Deploying East Side Transportation and Connectivity Solutions  
2)  Increasing Key Corridor Safety t hrough Connected and Autonomous Vehi cles  
3)  Increa sed Mobility and Accessibility t hrough Information Sharing  
The three pillars will result in improved quality of life in East Side neighborhoods, decreased congestion in 
key transportation corridors, increased safety throughout the transportation system, provide transportation 
system and connectivity access to all sectors of the city’s population, reduced negative environmental 
impacts, integrated city -wide infrastructure and systems, and move the development and economic vitality 
of the region into its next phase of evolution. Each pillar in our concept is described below, all three of 
which will be integrated to provide city -wide improvement of transportation systems in a Smart City 
environment. These efforts will complement those a lready underway in the Kansas City Smart + Connected 
City initiative.  
 
Kansas City’s extensive open data capability, resident in the City’s Office of Performance Management, is a 
first-of-its-kind data collection and analysis approach. New data from the cur rent Smart + Connected City 
initiative is collected through Sensity and Cisco platforms beginning in March/April 2016 and will add to a 
robust, existing open data system. The city serves as the major regional economic engine, affecting both the 
states of K ansas and Missouri.  The Kansas City area represents 38% of the gross domestic  product of the state 
of Missouri’s eight metropolitan areas, and the city’s metropolitan area generates Kansas’ largest GDP. 
Multiple state jurisdictions in the region require co mplex maintenance planning and synchronization efforts, 
but can also take advantage of more available funding and a greater spectrum of ideas to solve challenges.   City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  3 | P a g e  
  
Our three pillars include attention to key areas of the city that address the USDOT’s vision  elements and the 
building blocks for continued development of a comprehensive Smart City solution. The deployments 
described in our pillars will result in both short - and longer -term positive impacts. As the city becomes more 
accessible and connected, we will be positioned and able to integrate additional data and analyses, 
communications systems, and overall more intelligent solutions with other critical infrastructure and city -wide 
systems, including the energy and utility sectors, health options and sol utions, and even education.  
 
Figure  1-1: Kansas City Smart City Vision  
 
 
Pillar 1: East Side Transportation and Connectivity S olutions  
Neighborhoods on the  east side of Kansas City are in need of digitization  in order to help advance the 
economic and social environment for  underserved segments of the population , and to address p ublic safety 
concerns inhibiting growth and opportunity . This first pillar  of our Smart City concept focuses on transforming 
the easte rn third of the city along Prospect Ave . The population  in this area  is highly dependent on public 
transportation and cellular phone -based digital connectivity.  Average incomes are below regional average s 
and unemployment rates are high . Crime rates are hi gher in this area and economic development efforts 
continue to serve a population of citizens with a high rate of poverty.  
 
Our East Side Transportation and Connectivity Solutions  will focus development along an existing eight -mile 
bus line and bus rapid transit line that is slated to begin operations in 2018 by the City and Kansas City Area 
Transportation Authority (KCATA).  This line runs on Prospect Ave  bounded on the north by the Jazz District 
at 18th and Vine and on the south by the Marlborough Neighbo rhood and AlphaPointe, a comprehensive 
rehabilitation and education agency for people with vision loss providing outreach, services, employment and 
education  and is  the third largest single employer of visually impa ired individuals in the U nited States . Our 
concept in this area will  increase safety, mobility services, accessibility to the visually impaired, and 
 City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  4 | P a g e  
 employment resources and opportunities along the Prospect Ave corridor  via WiFi, connectivity, and 
additional transportation options . These effort s will result in an Initial Digital Infrastructure, or “Information 
Superhighway” that will enable citizens to meet and lead the rest of the city in terms of access and 
involvement in ne w economic models and activity. In addition, t he digital access and su pporting education 
and training programs that will accompany the digital expansion and improvement of the transportation 
system will catapult the area , and by extension the city, to be a forward -looking community rooted in new 
technology skills and access.  Specifically, the efforts in this pillar will:  
 
Increase safety  by integrating new technologies  such as  new gunshot detection technologies connected 
directly to active  patrol cars close to a suspected location, whi le notifying HQ. The results of the detection 
technology will be reviewed and analyzed in real time and integrated into the City Infrastructure Management 
(CIM)  Platform.  We will expand the current deployment of Sensity smart lighting and video sensor technology  
in the downtown area to this corridor , enabl ing a multitude of other solutions  and insights  that will increase 
safety . We will also consider the  deploy ment of  smart pavement that has sensors and embedded lights that 
further illuminate the environment.  Deployment of Connected Vehicle (CV) applications such as Vehicle 
Turning Right in Front of Transit Vehicle and Pedestrian in Signalized Crosswalk will also improve the safety 
of transit riders, cyclists , and pedestrians.  
 
Increase mobility services  by implementing dynamic ridesharing op portunities, additional bike share 
stations, vehicle share stations, and digital sensors on both bus stop shelters and buses. Data collected from 
these sensors will help support efficient movement of traffic, identify requirements for dynamic tasking of 
buses or other public transportation assets, and improve responsiveness of public safety resources. Kansas 
City will also utilize CV applications such as Transit Signal Priority to improve bus route efficiency. Interactive 
transit stations will provide real -time trip planning and arrival displays with information on multi -modal 
connections throughout the corridor .  
 
Increase accessibility to the visually impaired  by implementing CV applications such as Route ID for the 
Visually Impaired to assist them with th e identification of  the appropriate bus and route to their intended 
destination, transit stop navigation and audible signage, safe pedestrian crossings, and Remote Infrared 
Audible Signage (RIAS) technology consisting of infrared transmitters repeatedly se nding encoded spoken 
versions of the contents of signage through wireless communication.  
 
Increase employment resources and opportunities  by including public WiFi along the entire transit 
corridor as well as on the entire KCATA bus fleet (April 2016) to pr ovide an interactive service for citizens 
within the corridor and wayfinding applications that support citizens’ information requirements in real time 
including job search, education, transportation options , and support functions.  
 
Pillar 2: Increasing Key Corridor Safety through Connected and Autonomous Vehicles  
The second pillar to our Smart City concept is focused on deploying both connected vehicle (CV) and 
automated vehicle (AV) technologies  within multiple areas of the city, including on a corridor from the airport 
to downtown , and along the I -70 highway . In addition to many of the positive safety, mobility , and 
environmental impacts that are often at the center of CV and AV deployments, our vision also focuses on the 
interaction between people  using automobiles as their primar y transportation resource and the community.  
 
The goal of this pillar of the Smart City Challenge  is to improve passenger safety, increase efficiency across 
the highway networks, and validate the optimal experience for the operator of a smart and connecte d vehicle. 
Applications that can be tested in this effort include traffic direction or management systems, accident  City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  5 | P a g e  
 mitigation prioritization, and direct advertising that addresses an individual’s needs  along with additional 
applications  that will naturall y develop through Kansas City’s Living Lab . Kansas City also plans to  expand 
the planned one -mile “road to tomorrow” pilot into connective tissue that links thousands of commuters 
throughout the region and validates a realistic scenario that can be replica ted by other cities.  
 
Existing regional infrastructure and development efforts,  including midtown sensors managed by the city, 
regional sensors distributed over an 8,000 mile regional network managed by KC Scout  (joint TMC operated 
by the Missouri and Kan sas Department s of Transportation ), data from the region’s transit fleets, and ongoing 
efforts to construct a “smart highway” on I -70 within the city limits, provide the elements upon which to build 
to create an living  laboratory to address  the multiple ch allenges that commuters face daily.  
 
Beginnin g in regulated spaces like the a irport property or in bus lanes, Kansas City citizens are ready to ride 
in autonomous vehicles today. The grant will provide us with additional opportunities to expand and deploy  
the technologies in these areas. CVs and AVs  will keep passengers connected to directional or site -specific 
information, inform passengers about traffic issues or local events, and keep passengers safe. Kansas City 
will build on  the findings from initial CV and AV studies  by incrementally integrating these vehicles into traffic. 
Close collaboration between automobile manufacturers , analytics firms based in Kansas City , and 
universities will pave the way for future implementation in similarly sized and larg er cities.  
 
Our deployment of new technologies along the I -70 corridor will also address some of our freight challenges. 
Current efforts to address freight challenges include:  
 Smart technologies in use by the major railroad 
corporations operating under the umbrella of the 
Kansas City Terminal Railway   
 Establishment of a SmartPort, integrating multi -
modal operations and is beginning to add barge 
operations on the Missouri River  
Building off our current efforts, we will develop 
additional analyses to understand where t he need for new technologies exist , as well as  targeted plans and 
processes that will integrate new technologies and data management techniques in order  to further improve 
efficiencies in freight management operations . These efforts will also have a downst ream impact on the 
economic well -being of the region, reduce  pollution associated with the transportation industry and large 
numbers of freight movers, and improve worker safety for all the firms involved in these operations.  
 
Pillar 3:  Information Sharing  and Increased Mobility/Accessibility  
Our third pillar of the  concept is to increase the connectivity and information sharing by advanc ing the steps 
already made for new transportation options and technologies with the 2.2 mile streetcar starter line , slat ed 
to begin operation in April 2016 . While there is already construction underway  to build the streetcar, we will 
build upon this momentum to add connectivity, integrate the streetcar with other modes in terms of 
accessibility and scheduling, thus connecti ng new areas, increasing public transport options, and bringing in 
new technologies and connectivity to citizens throughout the city. Our current efforts to expand public WiFi, 
put in place digital information kiosks , increase speedy movement throughout  the downtown  along the new 
Kansas City Freight Landscape

hub in the United States  
The third largest trucking hub in the country  
Houses four multi -modal logistics hubs 
providing the full range of transportation 
services   City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  6 | P a g e  
 streetcar line, and deploy related  applications will be increased and expanded to include more connectivity 
and integration to multiple city systems.  
  
The current Smart + Connected City effort includes select 
smart streetlights with video sensors to detect blockages  on 
the street car line and improve safety, as well as t wenty -five 
kiosks that provide citizens the opportunity to learn about 
nearby activities, interact with the city through messaging 
formats , or obtain knowledge about city services if they 
have no smart phone. For th e Smart City Challenge, we will 
integrate the findings from the data receive d through the 
sensors and videos, as well as kiosks, with the other 
information from data across the city’s improved 
transportation systems.   
 
As Kansas City  moves  into the world of “Big Data”  we will 
continue to make data open and available to the public 
and entrepreneurs to develop innovative applications that benefit the local government and citizens. The 
city will  develop additional capabilities beyond the Smart Ci ty grant  based on data collected by sensors. 
Possibilities range from dynamic tasking of  public transportation assets based on population movement, to 
focused application of public safety resources based on sensor data , to decreasing  congestion due to 
interconnected traffic lights , and increasing  availability of non -vehicle tr affic.  
2. POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS OF KANSAS CITY 
Kansas City, MO meets the population characteristics set for the ideal Smart City.  
● KCMO is a mid -sized city with a Census -Designated Place (CDP) population of  459,787  in the 
2010 Census data  
● KCMO has a population density of 1,460 people per square mile  
● KCMO CDP population represents 29.75% of the Census Urbanized Area (UZA) populatio n 
 
Table 2-1: Age, 2010 Census  
Age Group  Population  Percentage of Total  Percentage of Total  
Under 18  111,058  24.2 34.2 18 – 24  45,913  10 
25 – 34  75,490  16.4 36.7 35 – 49  93,523  20.3 
50 – 64  83,097  18.1 29.1 65 and over  50,706  11 
As exhibited in Table 2-1, over a third of the population is under the age of 25, while close to a third of 
the population is over 50 . In the metropolitan area, the aging population is more prevalent. The younger 
population has been slower than its predecessors to acquire drivers’ l icenses  and buy cars and single -family 
housing. If these preferences persist, we will need to change our current perspectives on regional travel 
behavior. To the transportation disadvantaged (which includes the aging population ), public transit is 
particul arly important. The U.S. Census defines transportation ‐disadvantaged populations as adults age 65 
Connectivity and services  
We will collaborate with crowd 
sourcing companies like Bridj, Uber, 
and bike and car sharing organizations 
to offer an array of mobility services.  
We will work with Kansas City Power 
& Light to make the existing electric 
vehicle charging network more 
useable and efficient.  
We wil l implement road diets to 
redesign select roads/corridors to offer 
citizens more opportunities for safe 
biking and walking.

 and older, people with low incomes, people with disabilities, and those who don’t own a car (even if by choice) 
and would therefore be vulnerable in an emerge ncy. 
Table 2-2: Income, 2010 – 2014 Census  
Income Characteristic  Value  U.S. Average  
Per Capita Income  $27,282  $28,555  
Median Household Income  $45,376  $53,482  
Persons Below Poverty Level  19.4%  14.8%  
Note: Most persons below the poverty level reside in the eastern area of the city which is primarily populated 
by minorities (about 45% of the city population) .  
The 2014 population estimate shows a  2.4% increase to 470,800.  KCMO population centers  are located 
in the north, east, and south areas of the city.  The greater downtown area is located in western/central Kansas 
City. While this area houses many businesses and recreational areas, population density is low. KCMO has 
focused redevelopment and reinvestment in the downtown area, with efforts such as the streetcar project 
and corridors with the potential for high capacity transit improvements . Kansas City forecast s a significant 
population increase at a higher population density as a result of this development . Within three  miles o f the 
center of the central business district, Kansas City saw an increase in millennials of 63% in the past 12 years , 
which is impressive compared to peer cities. While the Smart City initiatives will help provide accessibility 
and equity to disadvantaged  populations, it will also attract companies and jobs to help o verall economic 
growth.  
3. KANSAS CITY CHARACTERISTICS  
Kansas City is nationally recognized as a  hub for civic innovation. L eadership is demonstrated by the ongoing 
renovation of Downtown, constr uction of a modern streetcar system, rapidly evolving arts scene, green 
infrastructure investments, and ground -breaking smart city technologies. Kansas City’s technology initiatives 
are a catalyst for conne cting communities and fost ering economic developme nt.

5.1 Vision Element #1: Urban Automation  
Embedded in our concept for Pillar 2 is the vision that a utomated vehicle (AV) technology will eventually take 
full advantage of smart city infrastructure and data to improve performance , resulting in faster, safer, and 
environmental -friendly t ransportation. For instance, AVs  will connect to data sources such as KC Scout , 
KCATA  to analyze signal timing and traffic patterns; sporting events and concerts; and other city activities 
that may cause traffic congestion. Automated vehicles will incorporate this information into travel routes and 
low level vehicle actuation controls, red ucing travel time and fuel consumption. While these are longer term 
goals, the Smart City Challenge will focus on extending current driverless vehicle testing and pilots at the 
airport and greater downtown districts.  
 
The MO House Bill (HB) 924 currently allows testing of driverless motor vehicles until August 28, 2018. As 
part of the Smart City Challenge, we will reintroduce a bill to extend testing. To promote automation 
development, Kansas City will begin testing in regu lated spaces such as  the Airport property and bus lanes. 
The city will also develop test bed like -environments in areas where there is existing infrastructure , including 
downtown and the Power and Light District.  The greater downtown districts will benefit  from the deployment 
of a smaller automated shuttle connecting the streetcar and KCATA stations or popular museums and parks, 
thereby improving mobility and safety.  
 
Automated systems will augment existing transit options and  be connected with one another resulting in 
shorter  wait time s. With the Smart City grant, we will begin plans and tests for deployment of an autonomous 
shuttle from  Kansas City International Airport  to the downtown. The longer term vision is that this shuttle  will 
be connected to the f light schedules allowing it to align its route timing to the flights departing and arriving 
that day, reducing  cost and vehicle emissions. The first steps to deploying such a shuttle will be a central 
part of our Smart City technology investments, focusing  on localized autonomous vehicle demonstrations 
and planning for full deployment.   
  City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  11 | P a g e  
 Other elements of our pilot activities that will include automation are the development of applications that can 
address the needs of disabled riders, such as those with v isual impairments, and integration of information 
to other parts of the transportation system.  
 
5.2 Vision Element #2: Connected Vehicles  
Pillars 1,  2, and 3  of our concept include  identifying, using, and analyzing CV  data from Smart City Challenge 
CV participants, public vehicles, and freight vehicles from partners to combine with existing  KC Scout, 
KCATA, and Operation  Green Light. These combined data sets will be utilized to facilitate smart travel 
throughout the city. Kansas City will benefit from e ight CV applications , five vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and 
three vehicle to vehicle (V2V),  deployed throughout our target areas. Applications are shown in Table 5-2. 
Table 5-2: Smart City Challenge Connected Vehicle Applications  
Impact   Applications  
 V2I Intelligent Traffic Signal System (ISIG) application adjusts signal timing for an 
intersection or group of intersections to improve traffic flow, including vehicle platooning 
through intersections. When connected with real -time city data, including i nformation about 
special events such as concerts at the Kauffman Center or athletic games at the Sprint 
Center, signal timing could be tailored to effectively manage traffic flows within the city.  
V2I Transit Signal Priority application  will incorporate connected vehicle technologies to 
Kansas City’s Transit systems. Buses will be able to request priority at intersections to 
increase schedule reliability and reduce time spent stopped at a red lights, thus reducing 
emissions.  
 V2I Pedestrian Mobility  application will provide information to pedestrians and vehicles at 
crosswalks and intersections. Mobile devices will inform pedestrians when to cross as well 
as warn people and vehicles of possible infringement while crossing. This application will 
also give  those with disabilities priority and additional time crossing making a safer 
crosswalk environment.  
V2I Route ID for the Visually Impaired (RVI)  will be integrated in transit systems to aid the 
visually impaired. Buses and other transit systems, like the new streetcar, will assist the 
visually impaired with identifying appropriate buses and routes by issuing information and 
notifications from bus stop infrastructure to portable devices.  
 V2I Railroad Crossing Violation Warning (RCVW)  application will alert and/or warn drivers 
who are approaching an at -grade railroad crossing if they are on a crash -imminent 
trajectory to collide with a crossing or  approaching train. RCVW will be developed areas 
that surround the Amtrak station and intermodal rail terminals located at the northern part of 
the city.  
V2V Emergency Electronic Brake Light (EEBL)  application enables vehicles to broadcast their 
emergency brake event to surrounding vehicles and provide a warning to the driver.  
V2V The Forward Collision Warning (FCW)  application warns drivers if there is an impending 
rear-end collision ahead in tra ffic in the same lane as the travel.  
V2V The Intersection Movement Assist (IMA) application warns drivers when it is not safe to 
enter an intersection due to high collision probability with other vehicles.  
 
5.3 Vision Element #3: Intelligent, Sensor -Based Infrastructure  
All three pillars in our concept will include deployment of intelligent, s ensor -based infrastructure that will 
facilitate the ability  to react in real -time to factors that affect transportation  and public services.  Kansas City 
is already managing traffic in the area through  KC Scout , a bi -state transportation management system  that 
uses cameras, sensors , and traveler information tools (i.e., electronic message boards , highway advisory 
radios, website, and phone applications)  to manage operations and disseminate information. We will plan 
and deploy key connected infrastructure elements throughout our focus areas in order to facilitate addressing 
our three pillars.   
 City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  12 | P a g e  
  
Kansas City is a partner with MARC in Operation Green Light (OGL),  a multi -jurisdictional system that 
coordinates more than 700 traffic signals throughout the region, including the Prospect MAX corridor. OGL 
currently provides pre -timed synchronization of traffic signals for peak commu ter periods and special events.  
A ma jority of the traffic signals in the OGL network can also support adaptive signal -control systems that 
provide real -time optimization of traffic signals, adjusting signal timing based on prevailing traffic conditions, 
demand and system capacity. We will f ully integrat e all traffic signals within Kansas City to OGL , which  will 
reduce congestion, leading to fewer CO2 emissions, and roadway delays for the traveling public . A fully 
integrated traffic signal network will give real -time traffic signal informatio n to traffic and transit applications.  
We will also incorporate this information to proposed connected vehicle technologies, which will further 
reduce traffic and fuel emissions. Connected vehicles will be able to recommend speeds  helping drivers time 
green lights potentially allowing them pass through entire corridors without stopping.  
 
The city will deploy widespread use of s ensors with video technology at multi modal transportation access 
points.  Bus stop sensors  will be able to identify an increased  number  of people waiting at a stop. This 
information will be sent to  buses  on that route giving them the ability to adjust their routes to make additional 
stops where there are more people or skip a stop if no one is there. Sensors on bike share stands wil l identify 
how many bikes are available in a specific location. This information will then be sent to users  for selection 
of available bikes  as well as bike share companies helping them effectively restock bicycles stands.   
 
The current  Smart + Connected Kansas City initiative includes Sensity smart lighting and sensor solutions 
throughout the city (with many already deployed) utilizing 
the WiFi network powered by Sprint. This technology will 
be extended to the Prospect Ave Corridor to help improve 
WiFi ac cessibility and safety.  Additional WiFi access will 
be available through other providers who are developing 
and employing economically sound repeaters based on 
available resources. Kansas City will consider adding air 
quality sensors to smart streetlights to better measure the 
improvements of smart city technology on the 
environment and feed urban analytics applications.   
 
5.4 Vision Element #4: Urban Analytics  
Kansas City’s S mart City concept, across all three pillars  will produce , transmit,  and use significant  amounts 
of data that will be leveraged to solve complex transportation issues. The Kansas City Office of Performance 
Management already uses urban analytics to analyze data for the city and update performance metric 
dashboards such as KCStat. K ansas City will work with partners such as KC Scout, KCATA, and Kansas 
City Power & Light to layer a rchived data on vehicle and traffic patterns with other  external dat a factors like 
road weather, energy usage, and accident reports to develop probabilistic  analytics that will prevent future 
travel incidents. Maintenance and construction crews will be able to use this information to work at ideal 
times, which will reduce mobility and safety concerns.  
 
 City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  13 | P a g e  
 To further identify traffic and 
transportation demands , Kansa s City will 
develop a real -time pricing analytic tool. 
The tool will incorporate pricing from  
existing traffic data,  electric usage, and 
parking spots with online payment 
systems to give real -time and predictive 
traffic demands. This information will be 
used to help citizens efficiently and  
effectively travel throughout the city. 
Predictive information from real -time 
pricing as well as other types of 
transportation data can advise a traveler when and how they should travel at any given time. For instan ce, 
the system will inform  a person  that if they  left for work on Wednesdays 15 minutes later than their usual 
departure time  due to traffic congestion , they would avoid traffic delays and arrive at the office at the normal 
time. This information will also  be used  to advise the most effective types of transportation for  a specific travel 
time and day, especially along the key corridors identified for the challenge – Prospect Ave, I -70, and 
streetcar.  
 
5.5 Vision Element #5: User -Focused Mobility Services and Choices  
Kansas City’s Smart City concept is in great part, across all three 
pillars, focused on improving mobility  services and choices. The city 
has the g reatest number of highway miles per resident in the 
country , most likely due to ease of access a nd culture of use, 
creating  a dependency on automobiles . The smart city pilot will 
allow Kansas City to shift some of the dependence on individual 
vehicles, by offering an array of mobility services  that promote 
transit usage . KCATA  is currently working wi th the ride -hailing 
company, Bridj  (a commuter shuttle service that allows passengers 
to request shuttle rides through a mobile -phone application) , to develop plans for new services  such as a 
pilot program slated to begin in March 2016 . Kansas City will co ntinue to engage ride -hailing companies to 
develop new services and transportation options.   
 
Our Smart City pilot will also include an option for citizens to access other types of transportation like Kansas 
City B -cycle , a bike share program through new applications. Kansas City’s kiosks will be able to  aggregate 
multiple lines of mobility services and tell citizens which modes of transportation are located nearest to them 
as well as consider the most effective way of travel . If the roads are congested , a travele r information system 
may advise that a bicycle is the most efficient way of travel.   
 
Kansas City’s Open Data portal gives the general public access to Kansas City data (budget information, 
statistics, sanitation and building data, transportation data, city maps, etc.). The Open Data portal promotes 
innovation and help s develop data driven technologies that will be incorporated in our Smart City vision. One 
concept that will harness city data is a mobile payment system  integrated with several transportation services. 
This application will allow citizens to conveniently pay for multiple channels of transportation from on e source. 
We also propose creating a smart phone application that will communicate with beacons on roa d-side 
infrastructure to provide contextual information and routing to the visually impaired to meet the challenge of 
 City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  14 | P a g e  
 independent travel for the visually impaired. Involvement from the Innovation Partnership Program (an 
initiative for entrepreneurs to appl y to develop, test and demonstrate innovative solutions with KCMO data 
and infrastructure) will offer collaborative efforts, which will enhance application development.  
 
5.6 Vision Element #6: Urban Delivery and Logistics  
Included in our improvement o f key corridors concept, Pillar  2, new technologies will impact the urban delivery 
and logistics element. The Kansas City region is one of the nation’s leading freight hubs, with infrastructure 
that supports goods movement by truck, rail, air , and water for domestic and international trade. The Mid -
America Regional Council (MARC) engages the freight  industry through a standing Goods Movement 
Committee and is in  partnership with Kansas City SmartPort, an organization focused on promoting regiona l 
freight and logistics.  Major intermodal centers to transfer freight containers between trucks and rail are being 
developed at the 1300 -acre Center -Point -KCS Inte rmodal Center in Kansas City,  the 450 -acre Northland 
Park, and the 1000 -acre Logistics Park K ansas City in its suburb of Edgerton, Kansas. The 800 -acre KCI 
Intermodal Business  Centre will handle transfer between trucks and aircraft.   
 
Kansas City will help improve efficiency through 
implementing and promoting the use of Freight Advanced 
Travel er Information Systems  (FRATIS) m obility 
applications, such as Freight Drayage Optimization and 
Freight -Specific Dynamic Travel Planning , at select freight 
hubs and intermodal facilities.  These applications combine 
load matching and freight information exchange systems to 
optimize operations. It will link drivers and freight 
management systems dispatchers to an intermodal terminal 
reservation system and integrate an appointment function 
with Terminal Queue Status and Load Matching.  These 
applications  include the traveler information, dynamic 
routing, and performance monitoring aspects  for freight -truck 
operations  and leverage existing public data, as well as 
emerging private sector data. While the truck parking is 
effectively managed by th e large intermodal parks, parking is 
a challenging consideration downtown. Kansas City will 
promote off -hours/over -night delivery downtown and other 
areas of the city that have limited space for truck parking.  
 
5.7 Vision Element #7: Strategic Business Mod els and Partnering Opportunities  
Kansas City’s vision for deploying new Smart City technologies across our three pillars  is reliant on effective 
relationships and partnerships.  We have already assembled a multi -dimensional team and are actively in 
discuss ions with other partners. Smart City integrated efforts are best implemented with a combination of 
private, non -profit, academic, government, and other agency cooperation.  Kansas City plans to develop a 
Smart City Challenge Management subcommittee to the e xisting Kansas City Smart City Advisory Board. 
The Kansas City Office of Innovation would maintain administrative oversight of the challenge while the 
subcommittee would manage operational oversight. Section 7, Team Partners, describes ou r current and 
potential partners.   
 
Kansas City Freight Characteristics  
In 2014, the transportation system 
handled an estimated 264 million 
tons of  freight with an estimated 
total value of $357 billion  
Largest rail freight traffic hub in the 
United States - carries over 300 
daily arrivals and departures  
Third largest trucking hub in the 
country – intersection of four of 
major interstate highways (I -35, I-
70, I-29, and I -49) 
Airport moves more air cargo each 
year than any air center in a six -
state region  
Located on the largest navigable 
inland waterway   City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  15 | P a g e  
 Critical to developing strong and valuable partners with  a diverse set of public agencies,  private industry, 
academia, various trade associations , and  non-profit organizations is gathering feedback on insights, needs, 
and concerns with any Smart City plans . The Kansas City team will develop and implement a stakeholder 
outreach plan during the first phase of the Smart City Challenge grant.  We will develop a comprehensive list 
of stakeholder groups to co nnect with, and search for and secure opportunities to conduct listening and 
feedback sessions to understand the needs of the community and ensure that they are attended to during 
our planning and deployment process. Consistent and regular communications t hroughout the project will 
ensure that we maintain strong relationships and take advantage of all potential partnership opportunities.  
 
In addition, we will call on the expertise of our partners in developing new effective models to ensure cross -
organizat ion collaboration to leverage the best ideas and expertise across any relevant organizations. 
Examples of these kinds of models include P3s, subcontractor agreements, and strategic alliances. Many of 
our team members are already involved in these arrangeme nts, as is the city with private companies and 
other government agencies. Within the region, we are well versed at collaborating across government 
agencies, based on our dual -state location and our established civic, community, and government 
organizations  standing working groups and projects. The Kansas City area currently hosts Kansas City Digital 
Drive, a bi -state non -profit organization committed to best employing digital technology to impact citizen 
experiences in both digitally rich and digitally poor  neighborhoods. ConnectHome, a collaborative team 
featuring technology experts from both Kansas and Missouri, is providing computers and training for 
underserved populations. Kansas and Missouri also collaborate effectively in traffic control through KC Sc out, 
which  manages traffic flow across both sides of the state line and executes Operation Greenlight.  
 
Kansas City is also committed to forging connections with other federal agencies i n applicable areas, such 
as energy and utilities , rail and freight ope rations, and health and education systems. Booz Allen  Hamilton , 
one of our partners , has a long history of working across all federal agencies and is already involved in Smart 
City efforts with many agencies, which we will explore for potential involvement  and connections to our 
deployment.  
 
5.8 Vision Element #8: Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification, and Electric Vehicles  
Kansas City is now one of the best places 
to own an electric vehicle as a result of the 
charging infrastructure provi ded by the 
Kansas City Power &  Light (KCP&L) 
Clean Charge Network . The network 
consists  of more than 1,000 elect ric 
vehicle charging stations, more than any 
other U.S. city, and is free to use for the 
first two years. KCP&L  is also 
demonstrating an end -to-end SmartGrid 
—built around a major SmartSubstation —
that includes advanced generation, 
distribution, and customer technologies. 
Co-located r enewable energy sources, such as solar and other parallel generation, will feed into the energy 
grid. The demonstration area consists of two square miles with 14,000 commercial and residential customers. 
Part of the demonstration area contains the Green Impact Zone, 150 inner -city blocks that suffers from high 
levels of unemployment, poverty, and crime. The SmartGrid program will provide  area businesses and 
 City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  16 | P a g e  
 residents with enhanced reliability and efficiency through real -time information about electricity supply and 
demand.   
 
Kansas City will work with KCP&L to incorporate electric vehicle smart grid technologies into their current 
Smart G rid capabilities. These technologies will enable the gri d to interact with electric vehicles in the home 
to charge at the most optimal time (usually early morning) while still assuring a fully charge . For vehicles 
using public charging stations, these tech nologies will enable the vehicle to identify itself to the charging 
station where the electricity cost can be automatically billed to the user – similar to using an EZPass on a toll 
road.  Kansas City will also  coordinate with KCP&L to evaluate possible  areas or corridors  to consider 
developing roadway electrification capabilities by analyzing data on electric vehicle use and charging . 
 
5.9 Vision Element #9: Connected,  Involved Citizens  
In the existing smart city initiative, Kansas City partnered with Cisco and Sprint to install a new public WiFi 
network downtown. This network will be used to support Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city applications, 
relevant to all pillars in our concept. The partnership is also in the process of deploying 25 intera ctive digital 
kiosks  along the new streetcar line and nearby downtown locations for accessing city services, current 
events, transportation services, local business 
information, public digital art, local history , and 
entertainment. In addition, these kiosk s may be 
able to serve as a reverse alert system during 
emergencies . Kansas City is also the first city to 
receive Google Fiber , which  has laid over 8,000 
miles of fiber -to-the-home throughout the region . 
Kansas City also plans to deploy additional kiosks 
and expand WiFi coverage in the Prospect Ave 
Corridor to provide additional connectivity and 
access to transportation services and employment 
opportunities, along with alert systems for 
emergencies.  Public WiFi and community interactive kiosks will make cr owdsourcing  data readily availa ble 
and increase participation.   
 
Kansas City will continue to focus on connecting the new type of citizen – the “digital citizen.” The digital 
citizen is a person or business who expects fast and efficient delivery of government services that leverage 
the power of social  media , mobile, analytics, and cloud -based technologies . Connected , digital  citizens will 
contribute data through methods like crowdsourcing to give smart cities more accurate and holistic 
information.  Also, Kansas City’s thriving startup community will be an asset when developing and deploying 
connectivity mediums, like mobile phone application s. The Kansas City Living Lab, a joint proposal by Cisco 
and Think Big Partners, is already actively working to accelerate technologies and applications focusing on 
citizen engagement. A smartphone application for citizen reporting could allow citizens to rep ort street 
maintenance issues  such as potholes or unplowed streets , accidents, and events that are happening 
throughout the city. This information would then be collected and analyzed by applications , such as the Booz 
Allen i3 -city prototype  (which harness es social media and connected vehicle data to enable la rge data 
analytics to enable a n integrated, intelligent, and innovative city ), and used by the TMC ( KC Scout ) which 
would disseminate that information to appropriate entities as well as other media cha nnels.  
 City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  17 | P a g e  
 5.10 Vision Element #10: Architecture and Standards  
For all aspects of our concept and deployment, i t is crucial to have a well -defined set of standards to ensure 
interoperability, consistency in deployment plans and operations, and adherence to the latest security, 
performance, and communication requirements.  All aspects of the deployment will utilize existing standards 
for deployment and integration of new technologies. During concept and requirements development, 
applicable standards will be ch osen and documented.  There are several existing standards  and architectures  
across multiple industries being used as the foundation for development of new technologies , including but 
not limited to:   
- IEEE standards for communications protocols  (e.g., IEEE 1609 Suite)  
- NIST and FIPS standards for security and control  (e.g., FIPS 140 -2, FIPS 199, FIPS 200)  
- SAE standards for vehicle architectures and technologies  (e.g., SAE J2945)  
- Connected Vehicle Reference Implementation Architecture (CVRIA)  
- National ITS Architecture  
- Kansas City Regional ITS Architecture  
All of these existing, and in some cases in -development, standards and architectures will be the starting point 
for the Kansas City team to develop our technical specifications across all new technologies, including how 
we manage and secure data ; build out new infrastructure or infrastructure components ; deploy additional 
applications and device -based technology ; and other back end system changes or integrations.  
Kansas City will ensure that we complete dev elopment of interoperability and interface architectures as we 
develop and deploy technologies that will be communicating with multiple systems.  We will utilize a 
systematic approach to review  all existing standards, develop  requirements based on operation al and use 
case needs, and develop new standards or architectures with the USDOT only where ones do not exist.  
 
5.11 Vision Element #11: Low -Cost, Efficient, Secure and Resilient Information 
and Communications Technology (ICT)  
At the core of any smart city and its systems that enable connectivity, information exchange, analytics, and 
new citizen services must be a strong, secure, efficient, and affordable information and communications 
technology (ICT) system. The notion of “smart” is predicated on the ability of data and information to easily 
be transmitted from a number of sources (sensors, personal devices, vehicles, infrastructure, etc.)  then 
combined at some location (anywhere from the back -end centralized location to an actual device) with 
advanced analytics to glean insights from those data and information sources. Kansas City has already set 
much of the foundation for this system and will include all needed elements in our comprehensive plan for 
execution of our Smart City concepts.   
 
Kansas City has an open data platform powered by Socrata , a cloud -based solutions for Government, which  
serves as one of the foundational elements.  We will build upon this system to develop detailed plans for 
ensuring that the ICT systems are all secure ; include redundancy and contingency plans ; are adaptable and 
scalable ; and include multiple approaches for visualization, reporting, analytics, and data storage and 
management. Advanced ICT systems include multiple ways to transmit and store  data, as well as provide 
insights and targeted information to the right decision makers at the most convenient location (be that 
desktops, integrated traffic management centers, personal devices, or vehicles and infrastructure elements).  
 
Security and pr ivacy are key to making an integrated and advanced ICT system operate efficiently and 
effectively.  As stewards of public data, the City is setting the highest standards through its recently adopted  City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  18 | P a g e  
 data privacy principles  and will continue to update those principles as necessary through the Smart City 
Challenge. We will develop an integrated security concept for attending to the security of data transmission, 
storage, and usage.  Our partner , Booz Allen, has led much of the work in the areas of security and privacy 
for the USDOT on connected vehicle systems, and is deeply involved in security and privacy concepts and 
systems for other federal systems, including those at the Department of Defense. The security for connected 
vehicles is underway with the Securi ty Credentials Management System ( SCMS ) prototype being built for the 
CV pilot projects, and Booz Allen is leading one of the pilot sites in developing and ensuring their security 
and privacy plans.  We will take these lessons and expertise to apply and imp rove upon for our Kansas City 
Smart City.  The scale of the project will be larger than that seen to date, since it will involve additional systems 
and data transmission s, all of which will be secured using the same tested approach of threat assessment, 
and control selection based on industry standards, such as NIST or Common Criteria control approaches.  
 
5.12 Vision Element #12: Smart Land Use  
Kansas City has been working to optimize land use by concentrating growth to avoid sprawl and advocating 
compact, walkable, and mixed -use development.  In 2012, the MARC Board of Directors adopted a Regional 
Complete Streets Policy, which seeks to increase mobility and access to resources and services for resid ents 
of all ages and abilities. Both Kansas and Missouri ha ve adopted Complete Streets policy resolutions, as 
have 10 counties and ci ties in the Kansas City region. MARC will continue to work with additional area 
communities to adopt Complete Streets policies . 
 
Kansas City will continue to incorporate  innovative technologies and strategies to promote and guide smart 
growth and associated compact, mixed -use, mixed -income land use patterns anchored by transit , bicycle , 
and pedestrian infrastructure.  Kansas City has utilized  smart land use practices to analyze  which corridors 
and subsections would be best to implement road diets to create safer b iking and walking opportunities. From 
this analysis, 48 streets could benefit from a road diet . 
Kansas City will work to modify these streets as they 
become priority on the ro ad resurfacing list. Road diets 
should also help in calming traffic along corridors with 
high numbers of bikers and walkers.  
 
The city will also actively  encourage and promote transit -oriented, mixed -use development along the 
downtown street car lane to concentrate growth upward rather than sprawl , within the context of the city’s 
Greater Downtown Area Plan . The City has also developed a comprehensive tran sit oriented development 
policy that is being circulated for comment and expected to be adopted later this year. Transit -oriented 
development should continue to be attractive to millennials which tend to prefer urban living. Kansas City will 
also make effo rts to make better use of downtown parking facilities by partnering with infrastructure and 
application developers to work toward multi -level, automated parking structures, or those with parking 
availability information displayed through signs and/or smart phone applications.

9. DATA NEEDS AND AVAILABILITY  
9.1 Current Data Collection Effort s and Data Policies  
Kansas City currently collects a broad range of data relating to city service operations and assets. Many key 
data sets are  provided in a machine readable format through the City’s open data portal, Open Data KC. The 
City’s Data Governance Committee is currently undertaking a department -by-department data inventory to 
identify and prioritize other high value datasets for publi c release.  
 
Open Data KC also helps to feed the city’s public -facing performance management program, KCStat. KCStat 
focuses on monitoring the City's progress toward its Five -Year Citywide Business Plan through monthly 
meetings as well as the KCStat  Dashboard, which provides an ""at -a-glance"" view of the Business Plan’s 
goals, objectives, and metrics.  Underlying KCStat and the city’s strategic goals, DepartmentStat is a 
collaborative effort between the City Manager’s Office and key service departments  to utilize data -driven 
management to meet departments’ goals. Not only does this effort focus on building capacity for data 
analysis, but these operational goals also are foundational for the city’s pursuit of its strategic goals.  
 
Kansas City has partnered with What Works Cities , a national initiative to help 100 mid -sized cities enhance 
use of data and evidence to engage residents, make government more effective, and improve residents’  City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  24 | P a g e  
 lives. This partnership has led to greatly expand ing the  existing open data efforts in alignment with best 
practices. The city also recently passed a revised Open Data policy which created the position of Chief Data 
Officer, extends open data to component units, and required more accountability from departments on 
opening up data. This new policy helped form a Data Governance Committee to build internal data capacity, 
stewardship, and utilization. After reviewing against privacy policies, new data and information generated 
during the Smart City Challenge will be share d with the appropriate partners such as KCATA and KC Scout, 
as well as published to Open Data KC and KCStat.  
 
9.2 New Data Collection  and Integration  
Kansas City proposes to collect multiple new data sets during the Smart City Challenge including , but not 
limited to,  gunshot detection, vehicle situation, social media , transit user volum es, and population movement 
data. This data will be used to optimize transportation services as well as to feed  the data analytics platforms 
discussed in the Urban Analytics vision element. A data bus will be developed to receive data feeds from 
new intelligent infrastructure, sensors, CV, AV, and potential partner s (e.g., ride -hailing companies). As with 
all other systems, the data bus will be developed with privacy and secur ity as primary objectives, while 
providing machine -readable, real -time application program interfaces.  Kansas City will manage this new data 
with team partners and share as appropriate  with Open Data KC based on open data policies to fuel 
entrepreneurship and innovation . When integrated, existing and new data will be used by partners and 
transportation providers and managers such as KCATA and KC Scout. The newly integrated data will be 
used to address further city challenges and  improve the quality of life for all citi zens by making  city service 
delivery more customized, targeted and seamless . 
 
Kansas City will work with other entities to integrate data to provide synergies for urban ana lytics by 
innovative applications. The integration of data currently takes place through algorithms developed by City 
of Kansas City Office of Performance Management or developed by a contractor supporting that office. In 
the Smart City Challenge, the Offi ce of Performance Management will work with partners to create a data 
hub that will integrate data from multiple organizations into a single platform. This new system will provide 
data in a machine -readable format, a portal for developers to build applicat ions and tools, and data logs for 
interested parties to conduct research.  
 
Integrating data with KCATA and KC Scout could realize huge benefits in optimizing transportation services 
and investment in t ransportation  services and necessary infrastructure.  Other benefits of integrating data 
from existing and proposed new sources include:  
 Gunshot detection data will be integrated with data on patrol car usage to improve public safety and 
better use of assets  
 Population density data may lead to changes in educat ion, training and aid agency planning activities  
 Population density data may also encourage business development on Prospect MAX corridor, 
especially with increased public safety that is data supported  
 
9.5 Cross -cutting Partnership  
Kansas City plans to develop partnerships to share data with KCATA, KC Scout, and other potential partners 
such as ride -hailing companies to improve urban analytics and services. By establishing partnerships and 
sharing data with other transportation provi ders and related organizations, Kansas City will be able to more 
effectively identify problem areas (e.g., congested corridors, unsafe intersections) within the urban 
transportation system. Th is new data could be used to furt her identify areas to deploy  V2I technologies , 
improve Operation Green Light traffic signal management,  and implement smart land use initiatives such as  City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  25 | P a g e  
 road diets. In establishing partnerships, Kansas City will analyze the data to be shared to determine the 
necessarily controls to prot ect the privacy interests of citizens and public security.  
 
Kansas City is also currently partnered with  UseAgility, a local UX firm, through the Mayor’s Challenge 
Cabinet to test potential redesigns of the Open Data homepage.  Kansas City will continue to work with this 
firm throughout the Smart City Challenge to integrate new data to the homepage.  
10. ITS AND CV STANDARDS /ARCHITECTURE  
The National ITS Architecture is a mature architecture that provides a common framework for the ITS 
community to plan, define, and integrate ITS solutions. The Connected Vehicle Reference Implementation 
(CVRIA) was developed to extend the National Architec ture to include detailed information to support 
development of fully interoperable regional connected vehicle architectures. The CVRIA and the associated 
SET-IT software tool will be fully integrated into the National ITS Architecture and software toolset to support 
development of interoperable architectures including complete ITS infrastructure and connected vehicle 
capabilities along with interface information needed for standards selection. The CVRIA is based on a set of 
applications defined by various c onnected vehicle programs. The source for all the application descriptions 
ranges from ConOps , Requirements Specifications, or existing Standards and Architectures.  
CVRIA has a list of CV applications grouped according to: environment, mobility, sa fety, a nd support needs. 
Once an application is selected, a description of the application is provided, as well as a physical diagram 
(as seen  in Figure 10-1). The physical diagram identifies the type of hardware required, and categorizes the 
hardware into groups . 
Kansas City will heavily rely on CVRIA and its own regional ITS Architecture to identify relevant applications 
and technolog ies to: reduce congestion, keep  travelers safe, protect the environment, respond to climate 
change, connect underserved communitie s, and support economic vitality. CVRIA will allow Kansas City to 
identify the type of application  and hardware required to implement the application.  
Figure 10-1: CVRIA Physical View which describes the connections between Physical Objects 
within the CV Environment for a specific application  
 
The Kansas City Regional ITS Architecture will help the deployment of interoperable systems without 
impeding innovation as technology advances, vendors change, and new approaches evolve. The regional 
architecture is  built upon standard documents f rom organizations such as AASHTO, ITE, NEMA, APTA, 
ASTM, IEEE , and SAE. An example of a regional standard that will be used to help Smarty City development 
in Kansas City is the ASTM E2468 -05: Standard Practice for Metadata to Support Archived Data 
 City of Kansas City, MO – Smart City Vision Proposal  26 | P a g e  
 Management Systems. This standard includes , but is not limited to , data management standards for  
RIDESHARE, KDOT Traffic Data Warehouse, KDOT KanRoad Reporting System , KCMO Parking 
Management, KCATA Operations Center, and Kansas Ci ty Scout Operations Center.  
11. MEASURABLE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

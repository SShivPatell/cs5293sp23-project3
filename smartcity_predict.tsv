1Introduction 
William T. Coleman, Jr., the fourth Secretary of 
TransportaƟ  on, painted a picture of the ways 
in which our society would travel and interact. Under his leadership, the U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on set about creaƟ  ng a planning 
and decision-making framework to guide that future.  Secretary Coleman’s future became reality…for most of the country.  For others, Ɵ me seemed to stand sƟ  ll and liƩ  le progress 
was made. Such is the case for the City of Birmingham.
Fast forward to today.  Under the leadership 
of Secretary of TransportaƟ  on Anthony Foxx, 
the U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on has 
developed a 30-year transportaƟ  on plan for 
the naƟ  on.  The plan, enƟ  tled Beyond Traﬃ   c, 
has a very clear thesis: the United States needs to pivot away from its reliance on the car towards mobility systems that are beƩ  er 
suited to ciƟ  es.  We couldn’t agree more!
The City of Birmingham will be one of the 
U.S. ciƟ  es that helps the naƟ  on achieve its 
transportaƟ  on vision.  The City is reemerging 
as a vibrant southern city, a place where people choose to live, businesses can innovate, grow, and thrive, and visitors seek out for historic, cultural, and recreaƟ  onal 
experiences. Through careful comprehensive community planning, good leadership, collaboraƟ  on and targeted investment, 
Birmingham is taking advantage of new opportuniƟ  es, and improving the overall 
quality of life for its residents.  Renewed investment in the City’s transportaƟ  on system 
will breathe new life into the City, especially those areas that are experiencing urban decay.Our City 
Located in a dramaƟ  c physical landscape, 
Birmingham is the county seat of Jeﬀ  erson 
County and is the largest city in Alabama.  It is ﬂ  anked by parallel mountain ridges of 
the southern extension of the Appalachian Mountains, which contain the minerals upon which the city’s early heavy industry was founded. MulƟ  ple railroad corridors that 
thread their way through the Birmingham area were the key to the city’s development as an industrial powerhouse, facilitaƟ  ng the 
transformaƟ  on of the area’s rich mineral 
wealth into one of the naƟ  on’s most important 
sources of iron and steel during the Industrial RevoluƟ  on. 
Economic decline iniƟ  ated by populaƟ  on 
ﬂ ight to the suburbs was exacerbated by the 
concurrent mass exodus of heavy industrial jobs from Birmingham. The iron and steel industry had long been the foundaƟ  on of 
middle income prosperity in Birmingham. However, by the 21st century, this keystone had been eﬀ  ecƟ vely pulled from Birmingham’s 
economic arch. 
As the eﬀ  ects of the Great Recession of 
2008 are waning, Birmingham is gaining vitality and populaƟ  on. This is in part thanks 
to a mammoth eﬀ  ort to reinvent itself as a 
more livable community, aƩ  racƟ  ve for the 
businesses and professionals that will drive our economy in the 21st century. The Smart City concepts presented herein will support this renewal and help expand economic opportunity to Birmingham’s long neglected  minority and low-income neighborhoods.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census’s 
Designated Place data, the City of Birmingham had a populaƟ  on of 212,237.  At that Ɵ  me, 
the City comprised 28.3% of the urbanized area’s total populaƟ  on, and had an average 
populaƟ  on density of 1,453 persons per  Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
2square mile.  This is well within the populaƟ  on 
and density characterisƟ  cs of a Smart City.
According the U.S. Bureau of the Census’s 
LEHD, the City of Birmingham contains approximately 163,000 jobs, of which just under 130,000 are located in the awarded Birmingham BRT corridor. The Downtown and UAB/Five Points South subareas combined have over 70,000 jobs, which is approximately 43 percent of the City’s total jobs, and 54 percent of the jobs in the BRT corridor.  The BRT corridor plays an important role in our vision to transform Birmingham into a Smart City. The vision will be arƟ  culated more clearly 
later in this response.
Other things to know about the City of 
Birmingham include:
• Birmingham has 99 neighborhoods
• Birmingham is the Southeast’s premier 
medical mecca
• 18,,500 students are enrolled in UAB
• Close to 80 percent of the State of Alabama’s populaƟ  on is within a 100 mile 
radius of the City of Birmingham
• Birmingham is served by ﬁ  ve (5) interstate 
highways: I-20, I-59, I-65, I-22, and I-459
• Birmingham is served by three (3) Tier 1 rail providers
• 60 percent of the 11 state Southeastern market can be reached by truck within one-day’s freight travel Ɵ  me
• 90 percent of the U.S. populaƟ  on can be 
reached by truck within a three-day freight travel Ɵ  me
In terms of how the City of Birmingham relates 
to the State of Alabama and the synergisƟ  c 
role of the two enƟ  Ɵ es, know that  Alabama 
is now the ﬁ  Ō h largest auto producing state, 
and employment in the sector is approaching 40,000. Alabama’s three global automakers, Mercedes-Benz, Honda and Hyundai, combined to produce more than 1 million 
vehicles in 2015, the ﬁ  rst Ɵ  me the state’s 
annual output has reached that big-league milestone.  All three automakers are exploring, and have incorporated autonomous vehicle technology into their vehicles.  This technology includes everything from navigaƟ  on systems, 
to communicaƟ  ons and entertainment 
systems, to automaƟ  c braking, and crash 
avoidance systems.
Automobile and parts manufacturing, and the 
technology that accompanies it has become the state ’s top e xport category , reaching $6.6 
billion in 2014. New auto-related investment in the sector during the past four-years tops $5.5 billion. 
Birmingham city closely aligns with the 
USDOT’s characterisƟ  cs for a Smart City, as it 
provides:
• ExisƟ  ng public transportaƟ  on system 
and plans for new addiƟ  ons to the public 
transportaƟ  on services; 
• Environment that is conducive to 
demonstraƟ  ng proposed strategies;
• Leadership with proven record of 
commitment and dedicaƟ  on, and the 
capacity to carry out the demonstraƟ  on 
throughout the period of performance;
• A solid commitment to integraƟ  ng with 
the sharing economy and share assets in a seamless way; and
• A clear commitment to open data and data sharing, thus making data accessible and usable by the public to maximize beneﬁ  t 
and promote entrepreneurship and innovaƟ  on. Become America’s Next Smart City
3Our Challenge
The City of Birmingham is challenged to 
meet its mobility needs because of its poor transportaƟ  on connecƟ  vity across all modes, 
underuƟ  lizaƟ  on of exisƟ  ng transportaƟ  on 
resources, limited transit, bicycle, and pedestrian opƟ  ons, and aging/crumbling 
and outdated transportaƟ  on infrastructure.  
The transportaƟ  on system has been cited 
as a barrier to opportuniƟ  es and access to 
both health services and healthy foods.  The historic network of roadways is not friendly to pedestrians or cyclists, and the general lack of pedestrian faciliƟ  es and inter-community 
connecƟ  ons are all contributors to a widening 
gap in socio-economic condiƟ  ons.  In addiƟ  on, 
the City of Birmingham also is confronted with a declining total populaƟ  on, an aging ciƟ  zen 
base, and concentraƟ  ons of poverty. Each of 
these issues is exacerbated by the poor quality of the exisƟ  ng transportaƟ  on system.
AddiƟ  onally, the City does not have 
informaƟ  on systems built. The technology and 
data that currently exists are disconnected and isolated, and endures in pockets/silos. The challenge is to integrate it all -- the systems, the technology, the informaƟ  on – and to exploit its 
power to the fullest.
Our Opportunities
The City is transforming rapidly and its change is inevitable.  Birmingham’s downtown is already experiencing a resurgence, and the City as a whole is undergoing a regeneraƟ  on of 
its ninety-nine (99) neighborhoods. The City’s revitalizaƟ  on eﬀ  orts are largely focused on: 
improving quality of life for ciƟ  zens; protecƟ  ng 
and enhancing the unique sense of place; rebuilding the economy with a foundaƟ  on 
of diversity and resiliency; and orientaƟ  on 
toward innovaƟ  on and a healthy workforce. 
Birmingham and its greater region are strategically targeƟ  ng catalyƟ  c transportaƟ  on 
and land use/land development eﬀ  orts in a 
handful of core areas and travel corridors, and are beginning to realize success through these areas successful transformaƟ  on.  For this 
success to conƟ  nue, the City of Birmingham 
needs to make a “big leap”, and modernize its transportaƟ  on infrastructure and service 
delivery. However, modernizaƟ  on does not 
mean looking to the status quo. Instead, the City of Birmingham is looking to become a naƟ onal leader for urban mobility.
In 2015, the U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on 
awarded the City of Birmingham a TIGER VII grant to build a bus rapid transit (BRT) system in three (3) disƟ  ncƟ ve travel corridors and 
the Birmingham City Center.  The provision of Federal funding to assist with the development of this important infrastructure component is a criƟ  cal catalyƟ  c element for the project.  The 
BRT itself is one of the larger catalyƟ  c elements 
intended to support, and in some cases help jump start, the redevelopment of impoverished neighborhoods.  The hope and promise of the BRT system is that it will usher in a new era of travel for the City of Birmingham; that it will strengthen the City’s diverse communiƟ  es 
by connecƟ  ng them to services and linking 
residents to opportuniƟ  es. However, the City’s 
transportaƟ  on transformaƟ  on does not end 
here as this is just the beginning.
Our Vision
Our vision is to uƟ  lize new transportaƟ  on 
and infrastructure technologies, Smart City elements, and innovaƟ  ve urban 
transportaƟ  on approaches to transform 
the City of Birmingham into a modern, thriving community that showcases the transformaƟ  onal power of the Smart City 
concept on mobility, accessibility, economic growth, land development, equity, and quality of life Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
4The City of Birmingham is looking to remake 
itself into a 21st Century City.  Its leadership has a renewed commitment to the City’s growth and development, and is acƟ  vely 
seeking new ways to aƩ  ract new talent and 
business.  They know that in order to achieve the vision that they have set for Birmingham’s future and overcome its past deﬁ  cits, that they 
need to take bold acƟ  ons to remediate the 
City’s transportaƟ  on system.
The City of Birmingham has a strong desire for 
its transportaƟ  on system to establish a broad 
reach, linking the City and the region that it serves to new markets and desƟ  naƟ ons around 
the world. At the same Ɵ  me Birmingham’s 
leadership is seeking to take advantage of both the City’s geographic locaƟ  on and 
historic legacy as the “PiƩ  sburgh of the 
South”, building upon the exisƟ  ng inter-modal 
freight rail network, and capitalizing on its new interstate connecƟ  ons --gaining from the 
combined strengths of individual modes.
Birmingham’s vision for its transformaƟ  on 
reﬂ ect a city that is intelligent in character--
harnessing the tremendous power of digital social networks, elements of the sharing economy, and technological advancements to expand its economic and social capabiliƟ  es, 
and exploit its tremendous potenƟ  al.  It 
is inclusive in its services-- always moving forward, leaving no one behind. The transportaƟ  on system is innovaƟ  ve in its scope. 
It derives its beneﬁ  t from integrated data, 
technology and smarter use of its exisƟ  ng 
infrastructure.
The City of Birmingham’s vision is closely 
linked with the ideas expressed in both its comprehensive plan. The Comprehensive Plan holisƟ  cally addresses the development of its 
communiƟ  es, looking at economic condiƟ  ons, 
land development paƩ  erns and trends, 
transportaƟ  on needs, human health dispariƟ  es, 
and the overall quality of life. FacilitaƟ  ng community reinvestment, especially in the low-
income and minority neighborhoods, is one of the primary goals of Birmingham’s response to the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge. Through its 
inclusive planning process and strategic public investment, the City of Birmingham has set in moƟ  on an economic engine that is gaining 
the momentum needed to restore prosperity to Birmingham’s neighborhoods. The new construcƟ  on occurring in the Parkside District 
and Woodlawn are evidence that with targeted public investment community renewal is possible.
The City’s approach to catalyzing a renaissance 
of its neighborhoods is to center revitalizaƟ  on 
eﬀ orts around “strategic opportunity areas.” 
The strategic opportunity areas are acƟ  vity 
centers that contain the necessary economic, social, and transportaƟ  on resources to help 
them be successful.  The comprehensive plan calls for linking a number of strategic opportunity areas together along the BRT corridor like a string of pearls, and locaƟ  ng BRT 
staƟ ons within them.  This acknowledges the 
transformaƟ  ve power of transportaƟ  on, and is 
key to the City’s revitalizaƟ  on strategy. In short, 
the strategic opportunity areas are intended to serve mulƟ  ple funcƟ  ons, and are envisioned to 
be the catalysts for community reinvestment.  One of the funcƟ  ons intended for the strategic 
opportunity areas is for them to serve as “mobility hubs”. 
Mobility Hubs are an aƩ  empt to address the 
negaƟ  ves brought about by land development 
paƩ erns that responds exclusively to a single 
travel mode, the automobile, and whose supporƟ  ve infrastructure (i.e. wide, high-
speed arterial roadways, parking faciliƟ  es, 
etc.), discourages the movement and use of other transportaƟ  on modes.  They are places 
of connecƟ  vity where diﬀ  erent modes of 
transportaƟ  on – from walking to biking to 
transit to shared ride services – come together seamlessly. They also support intensive  Become America’s Next Smart City
5concentraƟ  ons of higher density development, 
accommodaƟ  ng places for people of all 
incomes, age, and ability to work, live, shop and/or play, and connecƟ  ng communiƟ  es to 
the rest of the region through reliable, rapid transit services. In essence, mobility hubs are acƟ vity centers that integrate land use and 
transportaƟ  on, and epitomize the City’s vision 
for its future.
Mobility hubs are hardly a household phrase. 
But the concept of a central places that links diﬀ erent modes of transportaƟ  on, as well as 
other things such as shopping, entertainment, recreaƟ  on and family services – is fundamental 
to the City of Birmingham’s vision for its revitalized communiƟ  es. They elevate the 
importance of public transit, cycling, and pedestrian travel. This elevaƟ  on of importance 
is criƟ  cal to ensuring the development of 
an eﬃ   cient, sustainable transportaƟ  on 
system. Public transit and non-motorized transportaƟ  on faciliƟ  es within the hubs help 
to reduce automobile travel, which impacts air quality. Equalizing and/or prioriƟ  zing cycling 
and pedestrian travel within mobility hubs also helps in addressing community health issues by providing employees, residents, and visitors to communiƟ  es that host mobility hubs the 
opportunity for walking and cycling. 
Mobility hubs are proposed t o be lo cated 
within neighborhood acƟ  vity centers, and are 
all about making it easier to move from one mode of transportaƟ  on to another, anchoring 
seamless, convenient connecƟ  ons across 
the metropolitan planning area. They’re also about improving the relaƟ  onship between 
transportaƟ  on and land use. There’s no point 
building a mobility hub in the proverbial “middle of nowhere.” In order for them to work, mobility hubs need t o be lo cated close 
to many people, whether they are at work, at home, or at play. In other words, they need to be livable.ComplemenƟ  ng the Birmingham BRT’s service 
design and capital investment, which will reduce the need for customers to travel to Birmingham’s downtown to transfer, mobility hubs will help customers access the BRT and other local transportaƟ  on opƟ  ons, as well as 
provide a viable, cost-eﬀ  ecƟ ve soluƟ  on for “last 
mile” connecƟ  ons.
Table 1 provides a descripƟ  on of how the 
mobility hubs are envisioned to work within the City of Birmingham.
IncorporaƟ  on of new technologies into the 
infrastructure, tesƟ  ng of automated and 
connected vehicle technologies, use of smart data collecƟ  on and sharing pracƟ  ces, smart 
land use, and user-focused mobility services are all of criƟ  cal importance to the successful 
implementaƟ  on of the Mobility Hubs concept.
Our vision is for the City of Birmingham to 
be a living laboratory for tesƟ  ng innovaƟ  ve 
transportaƟ  on concepts that will allow the City 
of Birmingham to close exisƟ  ng socioeconomic 
gaps that have been deﬁ  ning transportaƟ  on 
mobility, access to services, and growth opportuniƟ  es for years and provide enhanced 
transportaƟ  on opƟ  ons to move people 
and goods in a safer, more eﬃ   cient, more 
sustainable, and more equitable way. 
If selected for the Smart City Challenge, the 
City of Birmingham proposes to leverage exisƟ  ng resources, expand on recent 
transportaƟ
 on and urban planning iniƟ  aƟ ves, 
and introduce new technologies, strategies, and insƟ  tuƟ onal changes to address local 
transportaƟ  on challenges, spur economic 
development, and improve the quality of life for our ciƟ  zens. 
TransportaƟ  on opƟ  ons that are currently 
available or planned, and that will support the Mobility Hub concept include: Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
6• Traﬃ  c Management Center (TMC) . The 
City of Birmingham operates a Traﬃ   c 
Management Cent er (TMC), lo cated 
in Birmingham’s City Hall. The TMC is designed to monitor traﬃ   c using 
CCTV cameras and control traﬃ   c signal 
intersecƟ  ons, and proacƟ  vely deploy 
traﬃ  c management strategies to reduce 
congesƟ  on during special events, 
emergencies, or daily stop-and-go traﬃ   c.  
• Public TransportaƟ  on. In 2015, the City of 
Birmingham applied for and subsequently won a U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on 
TIGER VII grant to assist the City with the development of its long planned bus rapid transit (BRT) system. The BRT system will be the spine of a re-imagined transit system, where the BRT serves a series of mobility hubs, and local bus services feed the BRT system instead of running into a central locaƟ  on. The BRT is proposed to a 
10-minute frequency during the peak travel periods, and a 15-minute headway during the oﬀ  -peak periods.
• Local Bus Service improvements .  The 
Birmingham Jeﬀ  erson County Transit 
Authority also is undertaking a complete overhaul of its ﬁ  xed-route bus services. 
While the major improvements to local bus services are primarily focused on changes to routes, improvements also include technology upgrades such as automated vehicle locaƟ  on (AVL), real-Ɵ  me vehicle 
arrival systems, automated passenger counters (APC), and electronic payment systems.
• Car Sharing Program . The City of 
Birmingham hosts a car share program.  The University of Birmingham at Alabama (UAB) Car Share, is operated by a private enƟ ty and is currently limited to students 
and faculty at UAB.  Employed as part of the University’s congesƟ  on management 
strategy, the car share program provides these individuals who need a car for occasional use an opƟ  on to rent a vehicle 
for a short period of Ɵ  me.
• CommuteSmart . The City of Birmingham is 
an acƟ  ve partner in the Regional Planning 
Commission of Greater Birmingham’s CommuteSmart iniƟ  aƟ ve. CommuteSmart 
is a commuter services program that operates in the State of Alabama’s four (4) metropolitan transportaƟ  on management 
Table 1. Mobiliity Hub Typologies
Regional Mobility Hubs Serving mulƟ  ple communiƟ  es, regional mobility hubs serve regional 
acƟ vity centers and have the potenƟ  al for the highest levels of populaƟ  on 
and employment densiƟ  es, and that generate the highest levels of travel 
demand to and from these centers. PotenƟ  al transit travel modes include 
high-capacity public transportaƟ  on services such as Birmingham’s planned 
bus rapid transit (BRT) system, as well as express and local bu s services. 
Regional hubs are deﬁ  ned based on their scale, character, transit service 
availability and type, and funcƟ  on
Community Mobility Hubs Community scale mobility hubs serve majo r regional desƟ  naƟ ons and/

to maintain 35 vanpools.  They idenƟ  fy 
2,559 acƟ  ve carpools in the rideshare 
database.
• Commercial Shared Ride Services . The 
City of Birmingham recently passed an ordinance allowing shared ride services such as Uber and LyŌ   to operate within 
the City of Birmingham. Many of the City’s neighboring jurisdicƟ  ons followed suit soon 
aŌ er, noƟ  ng that it did not make sense 
for them to do so if Birmingham did not allow these services as Birmingham is the economic, cultural, and entertainment hub for the region.
• Inter-modal ConnecƟ  ons . The City of 
Birmingham is currently compleƟ  ng 
construcƟ  on on an inter-modal 
transportaƟ  on center in its downtown. 
The Birmingham Inter-modal Center will provide connecƟ  ons between local bus 
services, interregional and intercity bus services, passenger rail, taxi and shared ride services, bikeshare, and the City’s urban trail network.  
• Bikes Share StaƟ  ons/Bicycle FaciliƟ  es. 
Since 2015, the City of Birmingham is home to the Zyp Bikeshare program. Currently, Zyp Bikeshare is a dense network of kiosks and bikes whose exisƟ  ng services are 
primarily focused in Birmingham’s City Center and its adjacent neighborhoods.  Zyp has aspiraƟ  ons of expanding beyond 
downtown, and is looking to provide bikeshare across the City, as well as in neighboring ciƟ  es. The Zyp bikes are 
“smart bikes.” That is, the bicycles employ technology that knows where they are, and where they’ve been. Travelers can check their previous routes on the web or within Zyp Bikeshare’s app, a useful tool for individuals seeking to achieve a health goal, 
planning enƟ  Ɵ es looking to idenƟ  fy travel 
paƩ erns, or for folks who simply want to 
know where they have been. 
Along with state of the art bicycles, Zyp 
Bikeshare also employs sustainable docking staƟ ons. The staƟ  ons use clean energy, 
and are powered independently. Both the staƟ on and bikes are charged fully by solar 
panels. StaƟ  ons and bikes c ommuni cate 
with the larger network wirelessly. StaƟ  ons 
may be permanent. However, their design allows them to be portable so that they can be adapted temporarily for speciﬁ  c events.
The City of Birmingham envisions that 
Zyp Bikeshare staƟ  ons will be lo cated in 
all mobility hubs, and provide seamless connecƟ  ons for travelers who choose to 
use transit, walk, or drive to the acƟ  vity 
centers and the adjacent neighborhoods. 
• Car Share Access . Car sharing oﬀ  ers a 
potenƟ  al model for the City of Birmingham 
in its quest to become a Smart City.  While car sharing is not currently accessible beyond the UAB campus, car sharing can support Birmingham’s eﬀ  orts to revitalize 
communiƟ  es and make them more livable 
by reducing the need for addiƟ  onal/
larger roadway infrastructure and surface parking. AddiƟ  onally, car sharing can 
provide a potenƟ  al economic savings for 
both government and private companies 
 Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
8by helping to reduce their ﬂ  eet costs, 
minimize local transportaƟ  on expenses, 
and meet sustainability goals.
• Pedestrian FaciliƟ  es. In 2010, the 
Freshwater Land Trust, in partnership with the Jeﬀ  erson County Department of Health, 
completed the Red Rock Ridge and Valley Trail Plan (Red Rock) for Jeﬀ  erson County, 
home-county to the City of Birmingham.  The City of Birmingham subsequently adopted the Red Rock Plan and has since integrated it into it comprehensive plan and supporƟ  ng Community Framework Plans.  
In 2011, the City of Birmingham applied for and was awarded a TIGER IV grant. EnƟ  tled 
Roads to Recovery, the TIGER IV grant is the ﬁ rst phase of a planned Complete Streets 
and mulƟ  -modal transportaƟ  on system, 
and helped the City to jumpstart the implementaƟ  on of the Red Rock mulƟ  -use 
trail system.  To date, more than 27 miles of sidewalks, bike lanes, and oﬀ  -road trails 
have been constructed.
• Smart Parking . With roughly 4,700 
on-street parking meters and another 7,000 structured parking spaces, there is tremendous opportunity for the City of Birmingham to uƟ  lize interacƟ  ve parking 
systems that would help alleviate traﬃ   c 
congesƟ  on, provide CiƟ  zen and visitor 
convenience and increase City revenue.The City has reviewed several Smart 
Parking System soluƟ  ons and is preparing 
to procure a system that meets its desired needs, such as the ability to idenƟ  fy 
available open on-street parking spots and open spaces in parking garages on an interacƟ  ve map.  The desired system will 
also enable user to pay for parking using a smart phone app that is compaƟ  ble with 
IOS, Android and Windows. Users also would be noƟ  ﬁ ed when their meter Ɵ  me is 
about to expire.
 Become America’s Next Smart City
9In addiƟ  on to these Smart CiƟ  es strategies, the 
City of Birmingham also is acƟ  vely working to 
embrace freight transportaƟ  on as part of its 
vision for the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge.  Building 
on the region’s success in obtaining a TIGER I grant for the Birmingham Regional Inter-modal Freight facility, the City of Birmingham is looking to develop freight villages, integrated logisƟ  cs centers to take advantage 
of its exisƟ  ng rail, highway, and waterway 
infrastructure.
A freight village is a deﬁ  ned area within 
which all acƟ  viƟ es relaƟ  ng to transportaƟ  on, 
logisƟ  cs and the distribuƟ  on of goods, both for 
naƟ onal and internaƟ  onal transit, are carried 
out by various operators.  Freight villages, as envisioned for Birmingham, will accommodate state-of-the-art distribuƟ  on centers and 
industrial acƟ  viƟ es that serve large market 
areas, and shun passive acƟ  viƟ es such as 
container storage. These types of distribuƟ  on 
centers and automated manufacturing and industrial acƟ  viƟ es are already beginning 
to occur within the Greater Birmingham region around the automoƟ  ve manufacturing 
industry.
The City of Birmingham’s goal in developing 
freight villages is to leverage freight operaƟ  ons 
to create economic value for underuƟ  lized 
and abandoned industrial sites, and in parƟ  cular provide 
a strategy for the reuse of brownﬁ  eld sites.  The City also 
is looking to create shared value for the communiƟ  es in 
which the freight village would be located.  This includes the development and expansion of support businesses such as retail (restaurants, banking, stores), and hotels, as well as providing oﬃ   ce space for 
non-retail businesses. Other City goals to be accomplished through the development of freight villages 
include: a. increased rail mode share, b. improved environmental quality, and c. the creaƟ  on of a more eﬃ   cient and cost-eﬀ  ecƟ ve 
freight delivery system.
The City of Birmingham’s freight villages 
are envisioned to be lo cated adjacent to 
modal shiŌ   faciliƟ  es. Modal shiŌ   faciliƟ  es are 
themselves located within the freight village.  Modal shiŌ   faciliƟ  es are transportaƟ  on faciliƟ  es 
where goods are moved between two or more forms of freight transportaƟ  on such as rail to 
truck; barge to rail/truck; air and rail/truck.  They will be sensiƟ  ve to the surrounding land 
uses, blending in with their communiƟ  es, and 
contribuƟ  ng to the City’s quality of life.  Ideally, 
they will employ the City’s newly developed character based zoning criteria, showcasing how open space and industrial space can coexist, demonstraƟ  ng the City’s desire to 
Incorporate “green building” techniques and employ low impact design for parking and staging areas. 
There are several exisƟ  ng industrial sites within 
the City of Birmingham with rail access that are proximate to interstate highways, and have both air and water transport nearby.  These are locaƟ  ons where freight villages might evolve 
and thrive.

The City of Birmingham will use the funding available through the Smart City Challenge to accomplish the following programmaƟ  c goals:
• Enhance Mobility and Access
• Improve Traﬃ   c Safety for All Users
• Reduce Environmental Impacts and 
Support Sustainability
• SƟ mulate Economic Growth
Speciﬁ  c measurable program objecƟ  ves are set 
to monitor progress and demonstrate impacts of planned iniƟ  aƟ ves on mobility, safety, 
climate change, sustainability, and economic growth. Goals and objecƟ  ves are summarized 
in Table xx along with corresponding performance measures. These are in line with programmaƟ  c goals set forward by the

12technologies and iniƟ  aƟ ves undertaken as part 
of the Smart City Challenge and summarize lessons learned for the beneﬁ  t of other ciƟ  es 
facing similar challenges. Also, remaining technical, insƟ  tuƟ onal, and policy challenges 
related to deployment of systems that support Smart City prioriƟ  es will be idenƟ  ﬁ ed and 
countermeasures to address them will be presented.
Our Approach
Building on our current assets and strategic plans for moving Birmingham forward, we intend to use the Smart City Challenge funding to introduce smart, technology-driven transportaƟ  on improvements that will address 
current transportaƟ  on challenges idenƟ  ﬁ ed 
within a city and provide equitable, high quality transportaƟ  on opƟ  ons and services 
to fulﬁ  ll the needs of the traveling public and 
transportaƟ  on industries.
The City’s vision for its transformaƟ  on into a 
Smart City is inclusive of many of the elements of the USDOT’s deﬁ  niƟ on of a smart city.  As 
such, several Smart City transportaƟ  on systems 
improvements and innovaƟ  ons which are 
envisioned to be employed in Birmingham are closely linked with USDOT’s vision elements of a successful Smart City. Examples include the following: 
• Connected Vehicles . The City of 
Birmingham plans to uƟ  lize funds from 
the Smart City Challenge to instrument its infrastructure to meet the transportaƟ  on 
mobility needs of the future.  Two-way short-to- medium-range wireless communicaƟ  ons capability is an important 
ﬁ rst step in this direcƟ  on. The City will use 
Dedicat ed Short Range Communi caƟ ons 
(DSRC) technology to enable informaƟ  on 
sharing among instrumented vehicles (V2V) and between instrumented vehicles 
and infrastructure (V2I) which is crucial for allowing tesƟ  ng and adopƟ  on of 
connected vehicles. Furthermore, the City will work with the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham -- the Birmingham region’s metropolitan planning organizaƟ  on and Central Alabama’s 
regional transportaƟ  on organizaƟ  on, the 
Alabama Department of TransportaƟ  on, 
and communicaƟ  ons providers to integrate 
various communicaƟ  ons plaƞ  orms that are 
enabled by either DSRC or other available networks in support of connected vehicles deployment.  This includes communicaƟ  ons 
technology such as cellular, Wi-Fi, or satellite.  Those communicaƟ  ons remove 
exisƟ  ng barriers through the promoƟ  on of 
shared transportaƟ  on processes, shared 
resources, and common rules of operaƟ  on.
Assuming the maturity of naƟ  onal research 
and development eﬀ  orts in the area of 
connected vehicles in the near future, the City of Birmingham will acƟ  vely seek 
opportuniƟ  es to parƟ  cipate in pilot tesƟ  ng 
 Become America’s Next Smart City
13of connected vehicle concepts. As an early 
adopter of connected vehicles the City of Birmingham will validate its designaƟ  on 
as Smart City and will play an important role in connected vehicles evaluaƟ  on 
and technology transfer iniƟ  aƟ ves. The 
City also will work with BJCTA to explore opportuniƟ  es for instrumentaƟ  on of transit 
buses so that they can become part of the 
connected vehicles program.
Working closely with experts at the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham, the City will develop and implement a comprehensive plan for assessing impacts of connected vehicles deployment on congesƟ  on, traﬃ   c safety, fuel consumpƟ  on, 
air quality, and user saƟ  sfacƟ  on. 
Technology transfer, training, and outreach will provide evidence of the impacts of connected vehicles on mobility, safety, and the environment and will facilitate enhanced adopƟ  on and deployment of 
connected vehicles in other medium size ciƟ es in the future.
• Automated Transit Networks . The City of 
Birmingham understands the importance of urban automaƟ  on and plans to work 
closely with researcher partners at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the automoƟ  ve industry to remove 
insƟ tuƟ onal barriers and address new 
technical and policy challenges associated with vehicle automaƟ  on. The City of 
Birmingham is interested in pursuing the development and tesƟ  ng of an Automated 
Transit Network, more commonly known as Personal Rapid Transit (PRT).  PRT is probably best described as a hybrid between the private car and public transit. In concept, PRT vehicles could hold up to four people or fewer, mimicking the private, quiet ride of a car. RelaƟ  ve to 
exisƟ  ng transportaƟ  on alternaƟ  ves, 
there would be very liƩ  le emissions, no 
traﬃ  c congesƟ  on, no loud noises, and no oﬀ ensive odors produced by PRTs. PRT 
could eﬀ  ecƟ vely supplement Birmingham’s 
soon to be constructed bus rapid transit system, and encourage car-free development by providing desƟ  naƟ on-to-
desƟ naƟ on service with minimal walking to 
and from staƟ  ons. 
PRT is envisioned to be an important 
part of Birmingham’s ShuƩ  lesworth 
InternaƟ  onal Airport’s conƟ  nued evoluƟ  on, 
providing criƟ  cal connecƟ  ons between the 
airport terminal and its soon to be built consolidated rental car facility, proposed oﬃ  ce and light industrial development 
on adjacent properƟ  es, and hotel and 
conference space, and at the Uptown development lo cated a t the edge of 
downtown Birmingham.
• Intelligent, Sensor-Based Infrastructure . 
As a Smart City, the City of Birmingham realizes the importance of installing sensors on the transportaƟ  on network to 
monitor traﬃ   c condiƟ  ons, opƟ  mize signal 
Ɵ mings, support incident management, 
and facilitate informed decisions on mode choice, given real Ɵ  me informaƟ  on and 
available opƟ  ons. Birmingham is commiƩ  ed 
to addressing this need and plans to collaborate with the Alabama Department of TransportaƟ  on and experts at UAB to 
develop and implement sensor deployment 
 Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
14plans that meet current and future 
needs of transportaƟ  on infrastructure 
instrumentaƟ  on.
A Smart City requires the use of technology 
to collect, process, and disseminate informaƟ  on thus allowing system managers 
and users to opƟ  mize eﬃ   ciency, safety, and 
conserve resources. The instrumentaƟ  on 
of vehicles, roadways, and other infrastructure with sensors, as well as the use of supporƟ  ng resources (such as video 
monitoring, tracking of GPS data from tags or mobile phone signals, smart fare cards) to monitor traﬃ   c condiƟ  ons and track 
the movement of vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists in real Ɵ  me are all essenƟ  al 
ingredients for the delivery of a successful, integrated transportaƟ  on program that 
provides eﬃ   ciency 
and choice as part of a Smart City 
paradigm. 
DSRC wireless 
communicaƟ  ons, 
GPS, and vehicles sensors are needed to enable the exchange of informaƟ  on among 
connected vehicles and between instrumented vehicles and the infrastructure.  Smart phone apps allow users to get real Ɵ  me informaƟ  on about transit 
schedules, car-sharing opƟ  ons, bike-
sharing locaƟ  ons, and parking availability.  
AddiƟ  onally, smart sensors can be used 
to monitor conƟ  nuously the condiƟ  ons 
of transportaƟ  on network assets in order 
to opƟ  mize resources used for operaƟ  on 
and maintenance. Moreover, availability of robust data can help tremendously the City of Birmingham in its eﬀ  orts to prioriƟ  ze 
needs and make smart investment 
decisions in the future. 
Sensors may be also needed in buildings 
and other infrastructure elements to monitor their condiƟ  on, manage water use 
and wastewater, or for smart-grid energy transmission. For example, electrochemical sensors can be used to determine the vapors emanaƟ  ng from organic pollutants 
during rain events in storm drains and detect the chemical composiƟ  on of the 
contaminants. The chemical sensors can then be used to idenƟ  fy locaƟ  ons most 
sensiƟ  ve to polluƟ  on during rain events, 
which ulƟ  mately discharge untreated 
into receiving waters (such as rivers and streams). The City of Birmingham will work 
closely with local uƟ liƟ es companies to 
leverage resources from the Smart City Challenge program in order to introduce sensor instrumentaƟ  on 
on the Birmingham testbed. In addiƟ  on 
to using sensors as part of an intelligent infrastructure, Birmingham will explore the use of interacƟ  ve 
technologies, such as crowd-sourcing, to get informaƟ  on about 
ciƟ zens’ needs and preferences, which will 
help decision makers to address key issues aﬀ ecƟ ng the public as part of the Smart 
City program.
Some challenges sƟ  ll remain related to data 
fusion, integraƟ  on, and storage of the vast 
amounts of data expected to be generated within a Smart City context. The City of 
 Become America’s Next Smart City
15Birmingham will rely on the experƟ  se of 
faculty at UAB to develop and employ appropriate data mining techniques that will assist greatly to interpret and use the data in eﬃ   cient and creaƟ  ve ways for the 
beneﬁ  t of the public.
• Urban AnalyƟ  cs. The mulƟ  -modal 
transportaƟ  on system envisioned for 
Birmingham will be driven by data. Data will allow system planning that truly reﬂ ects demand and community needs. 
The operaƟ  on and eﬀ  ecƟ veness of the 
transportaƟ  on system will be conƟ  nuously 
monitored in real-Ɵ  me, ensuring that 
community needs are being met regardless of condiƟ  ons. Data gathered from a variety 
of sources will allow the integraƟ  on of 
mobility with broader goals of community health and economic vitality. All of this will rely on the collecƟ  on of data from mulƟ  ple 
(and someƟ  mes seemingly disparate) 
sources, synthesis and analysis at a data center, and its provision to all stakeholders in a Ɵ  mely and easily accessible format. 
TransportaƟ  on data will be at the core, 
but data related to community health, economics, energy, and resiliency will be integrated as well to ensure that all members of the community are being served. 
TransportaƟ  on system monitoring has 
tradiƟ  onally been diﬃ   cult for medium sized 
ciƟ es like Birmingham. Unable to aﬀ  ord 
the extensive detector and monitoring systems found in many larger ciƟ  es, data 
collecƟ  on has oŌ  en depended on very 
limited sampling eﬀ  orts.  Fortunately, the 
foundaƟ  on for data analyƟ  cs is already 
in place in Birmingham. The Regional Planning Commission and UAB established the Regional TransportaƟ  on Data Center 
in 2009, a partnership which monitors the performance of the regional transportaƟ  on 
system and makes data and analysis available to stakeholders. Currently the Center focuses on collecƟ  ng and analyzing 
historical travel data such as counts, vehicle speeds, travel Ɵ  mes, transit usage, and 
incident reports. The data are used to monitor congesƟ  on trends, idenƟ  fy hot-
spots for congesƟ  on and incidents, and 
prioriƟ  ze transportaƟ  on projects. The data 
are also used to evaluate the eﬀ  ecƟ veness 
of transportaƟ  on improvement projects. 
But this is just scratching the surface of what the Center will be as the Birmingham vision moves forward. The Center has recently begun to incorporate more mulƟ  -modal data for transit, bicycles, and 
pedestrians. Freight will also have growing importance, as Birmingham serves as a link between the Piedmont-AtlanƟ  c and Gulf 
Coast mega-regions. 
To tackle the extensive analyƟ  cs that will 
be required in the future, UAB has brought their Big Data AnalyƟ  cs Lab into the eﬀ  ort. 
The lab, which originates in the Electrical Engineering Department, provides big data experƟ  se across the UAB medical and 
research centers and is pursuing cuƫ   ng-
edge research with industrial collaborators. By combining data from mulƟ  ple sources 
in novel ways, Birmingham will be able to develop a mulƟ  -modal transportaƟ  on 
system that truly supports the vision of personal mobility, community health, and economic vitality.
• Smart Cards . The City of Birmingham 
envisions that access to all of the transportaƟ  on services -- transit, bikeshare, 
parking -- will be seamless. Currently, 
 Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
16the region’s transportaƟ  on providers all 
provide access to their services using diﬀ erent payment mediums. Public transit 
in Birmingham uƟ  lizes, cash, paper passes, 
and Ɵ  cket books.  Zyp Bikeshare users 
access bikes at kiosks using either a credit card or a pre-paid key fob.  They also can use their smart phones via the Zyp Bikeshare app.  Drivers accessing on-street parking and the City’s public structured parking faciliƟ  es use loose change and cash 
respecƟ  vely.
Smart cards, as envisioned for Birmingham, 
will employ new technology currently being deployed by the naƟ  on’s banks to provide 
travelers with a more secure payment system that is universally accepted, is ﬂ exible in its design, enables travelers 
to beƩ  er budget for transportaƟ  on, and 
allows access to travel across mulƟ  ple 
transportaƟ  on modes. Frequent use also 
will enable travelers to beƩ  er track their 
use of the transportaƟ  on system, as well 
as agencies to beƩ  er understand how 
the system is being used.  Finally, the technology will aid agencies to cut down on operaƟ  ng costs by eliminaƟ  ng the need 
to manage mulƟ  ple payment mediums 
and reducing the risk posed by fraud by physically collecƟ  ng money.
• Smart Land Use . The City of Birmingham 
has embraced its new urban future.  The Birmingham Comprehensive Plan (Comprehensive Plan), draŌ  ed in 2012 and 
adopted in October 2013, lays out a criƟ  cal 
foundaƟ  on for the achievement of a more 
vibrant and sustainable city and region. The Comprehensive Plan establishes an inclusive vision for revitalizaƟ  on. It 
oﬀ ers an exhausƟ  ve list of strategies for 
encouraging and aƩ  racƟ  ng community 
reinvestment, as well as ideas for how to develop healthy neighborhoods. This includes recommendaƟ  ons for a variety of housing choices accessible across a 
range of incomes, age, and ability as well as infrastructure recommendaƟ  ons for 
complete streets, and policies to minimize health dispariƟ  es.
Public and private investments in 
places and public ameniƟ  es such as the 
Woodlawn and Avondale neighborhoods, the Lakeview and Parkside districts, Railroad Park, Region’s Field, and the Birmingham Crossplex are all examples of the integrated, holisƟ  c approach 
that the City is taking to address the complex challenges it faces. The subsequent Framework Plans, district level comprehensive planning documents that build oﬀ   of the Comprehensive Plan, are 
the City’s primary policy tool for achieving its vision to be a City of Smart Places. The Framework Plans provide greater clarity, detail, and direcƟ  on for land use, land 
development, transportaƟ  on, housing, 
acƟ ve and passive greenspace i.e. parks, 
trails and open space, uƟ  liƟ es and 
economic development.
The concept of Smart Places revolves 
 Become America’s Next Smart City
17around the City’s vision for its communiƟ  es 
and neighborhoods to be beƩ  er connected 
to services and opportuniƟ  es, to be 
more walkable and bicycle-friendly, to oﬀ er a range of housing choices that 
are aﬀ  ordable to all, to be supporƟ  ve of 
neighborhood scaled businesses as well as the larger urban economy, and to provide safe and healthy environments for its residents. To that end, City through its development of its mass transit services and parƟ  cularly the BRT system, will 
establish a system of connected mobility hubs. Mobility hubs were previously described in Our Vision for Birmingham as a Smart City.
• Strategic Business Models and Partnering OpportuniƟ  es. The City of Birmingham 
will collaborate very closely with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and uƟ  lize experƟ  se and technical 
capabiliƟ  es of faculty members at UAB 
to plan, design, implement, and evaluate iniƟ aƟ ves undertaken as part of the Smart 
City Challenge program. A collaboraƟ  on 
agreement between UAB and the City of Birmingham was signed in February 2013 and marked the beginning of this successful partnership which serves as a solid foundaƟ  on for the Smart City Challenge 
program. 
Through the UAB Sustainable Smart 
CiƟ es Research Center (SSCRC), UAB has 
an already established role as an engine of innovaƟ  on that can transform the 
community through the use of smart technologies and informaƟ  on systems, 
eﬀ ecƟ ve transportaƟ  on alternaƟ  ves, 
renewable energy opƟ  ons, and sustainable 
environment soluƟ  ons. The partnership 
between UAB Sustainable Smart CiƟ  es 
Research Center (UAB SSC) and the City of Birmingham creates excellent research, educaƟ  on, and training collaboraƟ  on 
opportuniƟ  es within a unique seƫ   ng where the city becomes a living laboratory 
for implementaƟ  on and tesƟ  ng of 
innovaƟ  ve research applicaƟ  on to beneﬁ  t 
the community.
Moreover, UAB is a University partner of 
the Southeast TransportaƟ  on Research, 
InnovaƟ  on and EducaƟ  on Center (STRIDE) 
a Regional University TransportaƟ  on 
Center (UTC) led by the University of Florida. STRIDE University partners devote their energies to three major focal areas: transportaƟ  on safety, livable communiƟ  es, 
and economic compeƟ  Ɵ veness which are 
directly related to Smart City Challenge program prioriƟ  es. UAB is also a member 
of the NaƟ  onal Center for TransportaƟ  on 
System ProducƟ  vity and Management 
(NCTSPM), a Tier 1 NaƟ  onal University 
TransportaƟ  on Center led by the Georgia 
InsƟ tute of Technology. 
 The well-established partnership 
between the City of Birmingham, UAB’s Sustainable Smart CiƟ  es Research Center, 
and the STRIDE and NCTSPM University TransportaƟ  on Centers as part of the Smart 
City Challenge will foster cross-disciplinary research, training, and outreach that will promote the development of innovaƟ  ve 
soluƟ  ons for sustainable smart ciƟ  es and 
communiƟ  es and disseminaƟ  on of ﬁ  ndings 
for the beneﬁ  t of transportaƟ  on agencies, 
professionals, and the public at large.
UAB’s commitment to economic 
development is also aligned with regional and state strategies, including “Blueprint Birmingham” — the community’s growth strategy led by Birmingham Business Alliance — and Accelerate Alabama, which seeks to drive recruitment of new projects, business retenƟ  on and develop home-
grown start-ups.
Figure 1 provides a graphic illustraƟ  on of the

18many of these Smart City concepts are desired.
It should be noted that this document only presents a high-level vision for the Birmingham’s proposed Smart City technology deployment. A detailed technical and management approach for realizing the aforemenƟ  oned vision, along with speciﬁ  cs 
about the implementaƟ  on requirements 
and the metrics to be used for quanƟ  ﬁ caƟ on 
and evaluaƟ  on of impacts associated with 
deployment and operaƟ  ons are outside the 
scope of the current solicitaƟ  on.

UAB Bill L. HarbertInsƟ tute for InnovaƟ  on and Entrepreneurship  
UAB’s InsƟ  tute for InnovaƟ  on and 
Entrepreneurship (IIE) improves the eﬃ   ciency 
and compeƟ  Ɵ veness of its research engine 
in an environment that fuels and sustains innovaƟ  on among faculty, researchers, 
students and community leaders. IIE helps to accelerate new company formaƟ  on and 
technology transfer through improved and ﬂ exible processes that build on successes of 
the UAB Research FoundaƟ  on (UABRF).  Since 
its incepƟ  on, UABRF has generated more than 
$64 million in licensing revenues and helped created 55 start-up companies based on products and technologies discovered at UAB.  IIE is bolstered by the InvenƟ  on-to-InnovaƟ  on 
(i2i) program. i2i is a joint eﬀ  ort by the School 
of Business, UAB Research FoundaƟ  on and 
Birmingham Business Alliance to market UAB assets with high commercial potenƟ  al.
InnovaƟ  on Depot
Opened in 2007, InnovaƟ  on Depot is an 
incubator and economic development program that hosts a shared co-work space facility in what was an abandoned Sears department store in the City’s Entrepreneurial Center just west of the city center. It is the Southeast’s premier technology business incubator, and is at the heart of Birmingham’s newly designated Eco-District. 
InnovaƟ  on Depot also host UAB’s Oﬃ   ce for 
the Advancement of Developing Industries. The 145,000 square foot space is designed to accommodate as many as 75 small businesses and up to 500 workers. However, demand has been high and there are currently 92 companies employing 540 people working under the InnovaƟ  on Depot banner. , In 
partnership with the City of Birmingham, InnovaƟ  on Depot conƟ  nues to work to support 
early stage technology companies, and has seen those it’s taken under its wing stay local. About 90% of the companies that go through the program stay close to home when they  Become America’s Next Smart City

include companies such as RFID and Motus, a motorcycle company that employs an in-house designed and patented V-4 engine. The engine that Motus designed and developed the world’s ﬁ  rst direct-inject, liquid cooled V-4 
engine.  The company now manufactures from a facility in downtown Birmingham.
Workforce Readiness
The City of Birmingham has long been commiƩ  ed to workforce development and 
training.  Lawson State Community College is locat ed in the City of Birmingham, and is 
accessible by public transit.  Considered to be a historically black college and university (HBCU), Lawson State is a parƟ  cipaƟ  ng member of the 
Alabama Center for AutomoƟ  ve Excellence, 
and oﬀ  ers three auto mechanics programs 
sponsored by manufacturers - Ford ASSET, GM ASEP and Toyota T-TEN. These programs are designed to helps address the demand for skilled automoƟ  ve technicians, and reduce the 
talent gap between jobs posted and available workers to ﬁ  ll them. Ranked among the top 
50 best community colleges in the country, and consistently ranked in the top 5 of this group, Lawson State Community College also is one of the NaƟ  onal AlternaƟ  ve Fuels Training 
ConsorƟ  um (NAFTC) aﬃ   liated NaƟ  onal Training 
Centers.  NAFTC includes a naƟ  onal network 
of NaƟ  onal Training Centers which are post-
secondary educaƟ  on and training organizaƟ  ons 
that provide vehicle instrucƟ  on and a 
demonstrated commitment to move towards providing instrucƟ  on in alternaƟ  ve fuels, 
alternaƟ  ve fueled vehicles (AFVs), advanced 
technology vehicles, and related technologies. Since 2009, Lawson State has been training mechanics speciﬁ  cally 
in the care and repair of AFV’s and advanced technology 
vehicles to include electric vehicles.  Lawson State also is a top supplier of skilled labor to Alabama’s automoƟ  ve industry, and graduates 
have found gainful employment with Mercedes Benz U.S.A., Hyundai America, Toyota, and Nissan.
In 2011, Lawson State Community College 
was recognized by the Obama AdministraƟ  on 
as a Champion of Change for its work with developing the next generaƟ  on of skilled labor 
and providing a successful bridge between vocaƟ  onal and academic educaƟ  on. 
Lawson State Community College’s Birmingham 
campus will link directly with the Birmingham BRT, host a mobility hub, and connect to other area mobility hub(s) that are currently being planned as part of the City’s comprehensive planning process. It’s Bessemer campus will link with the BRT corridor as it expands west in future phases.
In addiƟ  on to training mechanics, there is a 
statewide push to by the Alabama Technology Network, the Alabama Industrial Development Training, and community colleges are trying to accelerate teaching speciﬁ  c technical 
skills. This includes teaching computer coding skills. Code.org, is naƟ  onal organizaƟ  on 
focused on increasing access to computer science educaƟ  on. Code.org is partnering 
with A+ College Ready and the Alabama State Department of EducaƟ  on, and will invest 
$500,000 to build on Alabama’s eﬀ  orts to 
expand computer science courses in K-12 classrooms across the state. The investment will double the number of Alabama teachers 
qualiﬁ  ed and trained to teach 
computer science in the state’s public schools. 
Our Commitment
Leadership. Since becoming 
Mayor of Birmingham in 2010, 
 Become America’s Next Smart City
21William A. Bell, Sr. has steered the City into a 
new and exciƟ  ng direcƟ  on. AŌ  er inheriƟ  ng a 
$77 million budget deﬁ  cit, Mayor Bell quickly 
took control and began transforming the City, bringing about a renaissance of development and culture, and ushering in a new era of economic prosperity.
Under Mayor Bell’s leadership, Birmingham 
has made key strategic investments to spark growth and revitalizaƟ  on. The development of 
a new downtown baseball stadium -- Regions Field-- the Negro Southern League Museum, and conƟ  nued support of Railroad park has 
brought hundreds of millions of dollars of private investment to the thriving Parkside district and returned baseball to the City of Birmingham. Other investments, such as the Birmingham Crossplex, the Uptown Entertainment District, and implementaƟ  on of 
the Red Rock Ridge and Valley Trail System are 
currently spurring residenƟ  al and commercial 
growth in throughout the city.
Numerous corporaƟ  ons have r elocated to 
Birmingham or renewed their commitment to stay in Birmingham. This includes Healthsouth, Steris, Kamtech among others.
In 2013, Mayor Bell signed a memorandum 
of understanding with the University of Alabama at Birmingham Sustainable Smart CiƟ es Research Center to partner on projects 
that would make Birmingham a more livable city. Through this partnership, Birmingham received one of 16  (one of four in the United States) IBM 2014 Smarter CiƟ  es Challenge 
Grants aimed at eliminaƟ  ng food deserts in 
Birmingham.
Mayor Bell is not only changing the face 
of Birmingham locally, he is Birmingham’s ambassador to the world. He has served as president of the African American Mayors AssociaƟ  on (AAMA), co-chairing the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors CommiƩ  ee on Human Rights. He is also co-chair of “My Brothers 
Keeper,” an iniƟ  aƟ ve by the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors and President Barack Obama.
The Sharing 
Economy . The City 
of Birmingham is commiƩ  ed to the 
developing of its sharing economy, and will conƟ  nue 
to integrate transportaƟ  on 
technology soluƟ  ons 
so that they support these highly ﬂ exible economic 
networks.  The City already has made it easier to share resources on demand, supporƟ  ng 
the development of the awarding winning InnovaƟ  on Depot.
The City has supported the development 
of other co-working spaces such as REV Birmingham’s SocialVenture and 55th Place Arts.  SocialVenture is a f acility lo cated in the 
historic Woodlawn neighborhood that oﬀ  ers 
Birmingham’s entrepreneurs, non-proﬁ  ts 
and start-ups shared oﬃ   ce and retail space, 
and a divisible space to house meeƟ  ngs, 
workshops and recepƟ  ons.  55th Place Arts 
oﬀ ers customizable studio workspace for 
arƟ sts, makers, and other creaƟ  ves. All of these 
faciliƟ  es -- InnovaƟ  on Depot, SocialVenture, 
and 55th Place Arts -- are lo cated in proposed 
mobility hub locaƟ  ons. InnovaƟ  on Depot 
already has access to the Zyp Bikeshare program.; the other two locaƟ  ons are 
proposed to have access to Zyp Bikeshare and BRT.
In addiƟ  on to supporƟ  ng co-working space, the 
City of Birmingham also supports the Urban Food Project. The Urban Food Project aims to build a robust local food economy while creaƟ  ng healthy food access. The program 
 Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
22assists corner store owners with shared 
resources that help them to purchase, market, market, and sell of fresh produce. The Urban Food Project addresses Birmingham’s food desert problems by assisƟ  ng Alabama’s farmers 
plan their crops and access underserved markets i.e. Birmingham’s food deserts, providing delivery services of quality produce to neighborhood restaurants and corner stores.
Finally, the City is supporƟ  ve of the sharing 
economy in that rideshare companies such as Uber, and LyŌ  , as well as apartment/
house sharing companies such as Air BnB are all now permiƩ  ed to operate within City 
limits.  Because Birmingham is the largest city in Alabama, its agreement to allow these businesses to operate within the City has opened up the sharing economy’s market to the enƟ  re Central Alabama region.
Our Process
Decision-Makers . A decision structure has 
been established that includes input from each of our key team members. A risk reward matrix will be established to allow the ranking of idenƟ  ﬁ ed components and opƟ  ons for speciﬁ  c 
projects during program implementaƟ  on.  
Each strategy and implementaƟ  on plan will be 
submiƩ  ed to the commiƩ  ee for review and 
ranked against the objecƟ  ve of the Smart CiƟ  es 
Challenge, as well as the available resources for implementaƟ  on.  Key decision factors 
include: a) opƟ  mizaƟ  on of exisƟ  ng assets, b) 
integraƟ  on with other program components, 
c) expandability, d) transferability, and e) the ability to advance Smart CiƟ  es Challenge 
objecƟ  ves speciﬁ  cally for mobility hub. This 
approach will allow for diverse input for selecƟ  on of technologies and approaches that 
best advance the City of Birmingham’s overall Smart CiƟ  es program, and generate outcomes 
with the maximum beneﬁ  t for the City. This 
approach also will idenƟ  fy acƟ  viƟ es that can 
be implemented in other jurisdicƟ  ons and naƟ onwide.
Each team member will idenƟ  fy one 
representaƟ  ve to serve on the commiƩ  ee 
and assist with alternaƟ  ve selecƟ  on. The 
commiƩ  ee will be chaired by the Mayor’s 
oﬃ  ce.
Program Management . The Program 
Management structure for the Smart CiƟ  es 
Challenge program will be put in-place from the iniƟ  al formulaƟ  on of the program’s 
objecƟ  ves, and will be implemented 
conƟ  nuously through the closeout of the 
program.  The Program Management Team will include:
• ndividual Project Management Plans
• Program Scheduling
• Financial Management
• Value Engineering
Our Risks
There are several potenƟ  al technical, policy, 
and insƟ  tuƟ onal risks associated with the 
deployment of the City of Birmingham’s Smart CiƟ es Challenge vision. While the risks are 
many and varied, most all of them might be avoided and miƟ  gated through thoughƞ  ul 
and careful preparaƟ  on, transparency, and 
educaƟ  on.  The decision -making and program 
management structure is designed to address many of the risks idenƟ  ﬁ ed herein. 
Our Systems
TransportaƟ  on Infrastructure . As of May, 
2014, the Birmingham metropolitan planning area’s funcƟ  onally classiﬁ  ed roadways were 
comprised of: Become America’s Next Smart City
23Transit Services . IFixed route and paratransit 
services are provided to the City of Birmingham by the Birmingham Jeﬀ  erson 
County Transit Authority (BJCTA). BJCTA operates 35 routes consisƟ  ng of a) 29 ﬁ  xed 
route marketed as MAX, b) one express route, c) two neighborhood circulators, d) one specialty shuƩ  le servicing the Birmingham-
ShuƩ  lesworth InternaƟ  onal Airport, and e) two 
downtown circulator routes.  All ﬁ  xed-route 
and paratransit services operate Monday through Friday between 4am and 11:30pm, and on Saturdays between 4am and midnight.  No services are provided on Sunday.
Shared Use Mobility Services . Several shared-
use mobility services are currently available in the City of Birmingham. Examples include Zyp Bikeshare, car sharing, CommuteSmart, and Commercial Shared Ride Services. Details about those services are available in “Our 
Vision”.
InformaƟ  on and CommunicaƟ  on Technology
The City of Birmingham is in the process of upgrading all its IT infrastructure that adhere to security guidelines and allows for a more robust and secure network plaƞ  orm. The 
City has already deployed VoIP (voice over internet protocol) communicaƟ  ons across the 
board with integrated uniﬁ  ed communicaƟ  ons 
systems.  Several ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems are already in place speciﬁ  c 
to ﬁ nance, public safety (police, ﬁ  re, courts), 
human resources, document imaging, body cameras for police personnel, and the ESRI GIS mapping system which integrates with our other ERP systems.
The City of Birmingham has already completed 
the required infrastructure, including the ﬁ  ber 
opƟ cs layout, to support NG 911 systems.  The

24City also has a built a traﬃ   c control center to 
maintain and monitor (24X7) more than 700 traﬃ  c intersecƟ  ons.
The City recently updated its web presence, 
incorporaƟ  ng a majority of “eServices” 
including: online business tax payment, parking Ɵ cket and traﬃ   c ﬁ ne payment, food truck 
vendor applicaƟ  on, etc.  An associated web 
app has been developed as well.  The City of Birmingham has also developed a public service web portal that will be launched in the near future.
Finally, the City of Birmingham is considering a 
GIG (gigabit) ﬁ  ber network “self-healing” ring 
deployment to the City as a whole that will provide high bandwidth internet connecƟ  vity 
to all City businesses and the public as well.
Intelligent TransportaƟ  on Systems . The City 
of Birmingham operates a Traﬃ   c Management 
Center (TMC) which is uƟ  lizing CCTV cameras 
to monitor traﬃ   c condiƟ  ons and control traﬃ   c 
signal intersecƟ  ons remotely in response to 
recurrent and non-recurrent congesƟ  on.  The 
TMC was updated in 2012 to include a new video wall, Ethernet switch, video management soŌ ware, work staƟ  ons, encoders, Ɵ  me servers 
and video wall servers.  This center is designed and set up to manage copper and ﬁ  ber cable 
plants.  It is the City of Birmingham’s goal to work in a mulƟ  agency/mulƟ  jurisdicƟ  onal 
manner so that the TMC’s reach might extend beyond the City’s boundaries, and aid with monitoring and collecƟ  ng informaƟ  on about the enƟ  re transportaƟ  on system using its 
network of sensors, cameras, and other technology.
ITS Architecture and Data Standards . 
Intelligent TransportaƟ  on Syst ems (ITS) present 
stakeholders with a variety of opƟ  ons in order 
to address a variety of transportaƟ  on needs. 
The framework provided by the NaƟ  onal ITS 
Architecture makes system, product, and service compaƟ  bility possible, without limiƟ  ng 
the design opƟ  ons of the stakeholder. As 
connected and automated vehicles emerge, expansion of the NaƟ  onal ITS Architecture 
and Standards is needed to provide the necessary guidance so that stakeholders develop systems soluƟ  ons that are compaƟ  ble 
in order to share data, provide coordinated, area-wide integrated operaƟ  ons; and support 
interoperable equipment and services where appropriate. The Connected Vehicle Reference ImplementaƟ  on (CVRIA) was developed to 
address this need.
As a Smart City, the City of Birmingham 
is commiƩ  ed to using the NaƟ  onal ITS 
Architecture and Standards as well as CVRIA guidelines to deﬁ  ne operaƟ  onal, user, Table 4. Birmingham Roadway System DescripƟ  on

25performance, and program requirements 
for the deployment of ITS technologies and connected/automated vehicle technologies as part of the implementaƟ  on process. 
Furthermore, the research team will document any exisƟ  ng gaps with respect to 
the use of currently available architecture, standards, and protocols in an eﬀ  ort to inform 
USDOT and standard seƫ   ng organizaƟ  ons 
about further needs for reﬁ  nement or 
development of new standards to support the adopƟ  on of interoperable architectures and 
integrated, fully open systems.
Our Data
Data Availability . To date, most of the data 
collected by the City has been historical travel data used for forecasƟ  ng and 
planning purposes. For the roadway system, Birmingham currently collects traﬃ   c counts, 
travel speed data, travel Ɵ  me data, and 
informaƟ  on on incidents and crashes. For 
transit, the City collects ridership data. For pedestrians and bicycles, the City has begun an eﬀ  ort to collect data on these modes 
through pedestrian facility counts. Automated data from the Zyp Bikeshare program is also now available and providing useful data on biking paƩ  erns in the City. Data are currently 
analyzed and warehoused at the Regional TransportaƟ  on Data Center, a partnership 
between the Regional Planning Commission and UAB.
 Data CollecƟ  on. The City will conƟ  nue its 
current data collecƟ  on eﬀ  orts in the future, 
but the goal as Birmingham moves forward will be to focus on:
• CollecƟ  ng more data from mulƟ  ple modes 
and sources
• IntegraƟ  ng data from other databases 
(e.g., medical, geospaƟ  al)
• CollecƟ  ng and analyzing data in real-Ɵ  me
• CollecƟ  ng data more eﬃ   ciently by using personal technologies and the smart city 
infrastructure to automate data collecƟ  on
• DistribuƟ  ng data and analysis in real-Ɵ  me 
to ciƟ  zens and stakeholder
These addiƟ  onal data will allow the City to 
beƩ er monitor the complete transportaƟ  on 
system in real Ɵ  me and shiŌ   resources as 
needed to accommodate changing demand or condiƟ  ons. This will require real-Ɵ  me data 
analyƟ  cs and distribuƟ  on, something for w 
hich the Data Center is beginning to plan.
Data Warehousing . Data will conƟ  nue to be 
stored, analyzed, and distributed from the Regional TransportaƟ  on Data Center. The 
addiƟ  on of the UAB Big Data AnalyƟ  cs Lab as a 
partner will enhance this eﬀ  ort.
Data Sharing . Because of the proprietary 
nature of so much transportaƟ  on data, 
sharing of data has been diﬃ   cult in the 
past.  Travel Ɵ  me data provided by the U.S. 
government, for example, cannot be easily shared with outside enƟ  Ɵ es due to ownership 
agreements. Similarly, freight data are considered proprietary by private carriers, who are reluctant to release any data related to actual types of freight moved. Even greater barriers exist with community health data, where personal privacy is paramount. One of the iniƟ  al, and potenƟ  ally most diﬃ   cult, tasks 
for the data center moving forward will be to assess these data sharing hurdles and idenƟ  fy 
the most eﬀ  ecƟ ve ways to resolve them. This 
will be no small eﬀ  ort, but will be essenƟ  al to 
future success.  The goal is to make data and analyƟ  cs available to local stakeholders in real-
Ɵ me.
The City of Birmingham is commiƩ  ed to 
publishing datasets online, in easy-to-use formats that can be analyzed, used and republished as needed.  An example is aggregated traﬃ   c accident data which includes 
locaƟ  on and Ɵ  me of day.  Currently, the City  Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
26is in discussion with the Code for Birmingham 
brigade regarding the establishment of an open data policy.
Data IntegraƟ  on. Data integraƟ  on will be 
performed with the support of the UAB Big Data AnalyƟ  cs Lab. With data anƟ  cipated from 
a wide variety of sources (highway, transit, freight, bicycle, medical, personal devices, and smart city infrastructure), integraƟ  on 
and analysis will require the development of protocols with the city and key stakeholders.
Our Influence
Through the Birmingham BRT, improved public transportaƟ  on services, Complete Streets, and 
pedestrian networks funding received from the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge will assist lower 
income residents climb the economic ladder to beƩ er long-term opportuniƟ  es for themselves, 
their families, and their neighborhoods.  The City of Birmingham intends to leverage the resources provided through the TIGER VII grants to catalyze reinvestment in the City’s neighborhoods, and redevelopment along the BRT corridor.
In addiƟ  on to the TIGER funding, the City 
of Birmingham has worked successfully with the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham (RPCGB), the metropolitan planning organizaƟ  on (MPO) 
for the Birmingham metropolitan area, leveraging federal funds for sidewalks, trails, roadways, and intelligent transportaƟ  on 
system (ITS) infrastructure.  The City’s work with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on the rebuilding of the PraƩ   Community following the April 
2011 tornadoes and the U.S. Environmental ProtecƟ  on Agency (U.S. EPA) in remediaƟ  ng 
the North Birmingham superfund site also are examples of how the City of Birmingham has leveraged federal funds.
The City of Birmingham also has a successful track record when it comes to leveraging 
private resources.  The construcƟ  on of Region’s 
Field and the Railroad Park in downtown saw the City working in partnership with the local business and development community to raise funds to construct these faciliƟ  es 
that in turn catalyzed the redevelopment of a once industrial area into a thriving enclave of young professionals, innovaƟ  ve businesses 
and entrepreneurs. Likewise, working with local non-proﬁ  t organizaƟ  ons such as the 
Woodlawn FoundaƟ  on, the City’s Woodlawn 
Neighborhood has transformed itself from one of the City’s worst areas into one of its most desirable.
Birmingham has successfully leveraged 
funding using such economic development tools and the Tax Increment Finance (TIF) districts and Capital Improvement CooperaƟ  ve 
Districts (CICD) to fund criƟ  cal infrastructure 
development and repairs.  The City is planning to use these tools to assist with revitalizaƟ  on 
eﬀ orts in the BRT corridor and at the BRT 
staƟ ons which are also the mobility hubs 
idenƟ  ﬁ ed in the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge vision.
The City of Birmingham and the State of 
Alabama are home to several ﬁ  nancial 
insƟ tuƟ ons that have both a naƟ  onal and 
internaƟ  onal footprint. These insƟ  tuƟ ons have 
a strong track record of providing philanthropic support and civic contribuƟ  ons that are 
helping to improve the overall quality of life for residents.
Finally, The University of Alabama at 
Birmingham which is a partner in this endeavor is commiƩ  ed to leveraging its relaƟ  onship with 
its research network and other local academic insƟ tuƟ ons to leverage their collecƟ  ve 
resources with private industry, parƟ  cularly 
within the State’s automoƟ  ve manufacturing 
industry to research and deploy Smart CiƟ  es 
technology and strategies."	rise rise meet challengebecome americas next icontents introduction challenge opportunity vision goal approach capa commitment process risks data influence lettersupport

February 2016
b 1. AUSTIN’S SMART CITY VISION—AND HOW IT WILL BE ACHIEVED
“Igniting Austin’s spirit of innovation to accelerate mobility that creates real opportunity for all.”
As the USDOT Smart City, Austin, Texas, will harness the power of technology and data to …
… help people shift their travel behaviors in ways that work for them.  Faster, better, cheaper .
… advance big societal goals for climate action and sustainability. Cut vehicle emissions.
… keep people far safer on our streets. Prevent fatal and serious injury crashes.
…. power up economic vitality. Create services, products, companies; give people a hand up.
It will take a Smart City  to seize the moment and figure it all out. Meet Austin, Texas!
WHY AUSTIN?
Austin is America’s “IT” City. We are the  capital 
of the state of Texas . We’re home to both the 
University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin)—one 
of the nation’s premier research universities , 
and a USDOT Tier 1 University Transportation 
Center for Data-Supported Transportation Opera -
tions and Research – and within close reach of the 
nationally renowned Texas A&M Transportation 
Institute (TTI). We are internationally known as 
a “creative class” magnet  where the mantra 
is “Keep Austin Weird.” We are “the live music 
capital of the world” home to SXSW interactive, film, and music festivals. We are a progressive, 
and innovative community that embraces climate 
with early adoption of all things green. Due to 
our younger demographics and an innovative and 
vibrant high-tech community, there is a demand for 
more choices for transportation that incorporate 
technology and keep people connected. Austin is a 
growing city that still has a connected, small town 
community feel that is part of our allure and charm.
Austin is already recognized by industry  as the 
place to demonstrate smart transportation tech -
nology. Austin is the first mid-size test city for the 
Google Car, a first city for Google Fiber, and Gener -
al Motors recently expressed interest in testing its 
automated vehicles in Austin in partnership with 
ridesharing company Lyft. Austin was chosen by 
Daimler as its pilot U.S. city for Car2Go, which has 
since expanded nationally. The business climate 
is seen as friendly toward autonomous vehicles 
and smart technologies more generally. The warm temperatures allow year-round testing. And, of 
course, Austin is a major U.S. hub for the high-tech 
industry, known as an Research and Development 
center. In 2015, Austin was named the “#1 city for 
tech job growth” by Forbes . In the last four years, 
we’ve seen a 73 percent job growth in the tech 
industry, resulting in more than 53,000 tech jobs.
Austin’s potential was also recently recognized 
by Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) when it was 
chosen after a nationwide selection process to 
be the lead partner for a new mobility trans -
formation initiative . Austin is making robust 
investments  in new transportation options 
– Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), rapid implementation 
of a bicycle network featuring new protected 
facilities, the first U.S. City for Daimler’s Car2Go, 
the B-Cycle Bike Share system, and more. 
Austin’s public transit agency has received 
national recognition for its innovation with 
mobile ticketing . Additionally, and importantly, 
Austin  owns its electric utility , Austin Energy, 
which has been a leading innovator for climate 
protection, clean power, electric vehicles, and a 
smart grid. 
Among mid-size cities, Austin’s need for smart 
transportation solutions may be the greatest due 
to its  rapid growth and booming economy . 
Austin is the fastest-growing mid-size city in the 
U.S. (1.8 million regional population, a 2.8 percent 
growth rate), absorbing tens of thousands of new

1 delay is projected to more than double in the 
next 20 years.
Sprawl:  Like many U.S. cities, Austin grew in 
sprawling patterns in the latter half of the 20th 
century. In our outlying car-dependent areas, 
people lack good transportation options and 
often have no access to transit.
Safety:  Transportation system safety has been 
a huge concern for the City as 2015 proved to 
be a record year for traffic fatalities with 102 
deaths. The City is seeking ways to leverage 
smart transportation technologies and data to 
address unsafe conditions and provide more 
educational opportunities before a serious 
injury or fatality occurs. 
Climate Change and Emissions:  Austin’s 
transportation infrastructure has been nega -
tively impacted by recent droughts -  floods, and 
wildfires as documented in a recent City cli -
mate resiliency project funded by FHWA. As of residents annually. A city in such constant flux 
provides a fertile environment for innovation as 
people adopt new travel options and behaviors. 
Austin is prepared to take advantage of this op -
portunity to hasten its transition to a Smart City. 
Many of the ideas in this proposal have resulted 
from discussions with the City’s partners for over 
a year. Additionally, Austin has several relevant 
plans in place that have been crafted within an 
extensive public process . These include plans 
for smart growth  (Imagine Austin Comprehen -
sive Plan, 2012), climate action  (Community Cli -
mate Plan, 2015), zero traffic fatalities  (recently 
selected as a Vision Zero Network city), and more. 
Further, Austin is committed to tech incubation  
and was recently listed by Entrepreneur Magazine 
as the #1 city for startups. 
OUR CHALLENGES 
Austin is also on some “top” lists we are not so 
proud of, and from which our residents want to 
escape. Despite the incredible advantages we 
enjoy, we are too often stuck in traffic, frustrated, 
and demanding mobility solutions: 
Traffic:  Austin routinely rates as one of the 
most congested cities in the country (with 
I-35 through Downtown among the very worst 
freeway segments in the nation). In Texas A&M 
University Transportation Institute’s (TTI) 2015 
Urban Mobility Scorecard, Austin commuters 
suffered the third greatest delay – 52 hours 
per year - for “large” urban areas in the U.S. 
If the growth trajectory continues, peak hour 2010, about 35 percent of annual greenhouse 
gas emissions were from the transportation 
sector. The Austin region is currently in attain -
ment due to an early action compact with the 
EPA, but is at the tipping point of falling into 
non-attainment for air quality.
Perhaps even more importantly, our community 
faces significant Economic Disparity .  We 
recognize that daily life is a struggle for many 
people – especially for our low-income residents, 
who are disproportionately female and people 
of color.  Austin is a diverse “majority minority” 
city and the most economically segregated large 
metro area in the US, according to a recently 
released study by the Martin Prosperity Institute.   
In Travis County, Hispanics (now about 35 percent 
of the population and growing) are 3.4 times more 
likely than Whites to be living in poverty; African 
Americans are 2.8 times more likely.

2 Our fastest-growing population sector is children 
living in poverty. According to the Brookings Insti -
tute, the Austin metro area ranks #2 in the nation 
for percentage growth of poverty in the suburbs 
between 2000 and 2011.  Our suburban poor are 
generally not well transit-connected, nor within 
reasonable walking or biking distance of jobs; they 
are painfully burdened by the costs of car owner -
ship, which can drive them further into poverty.  
New transportation options, coupled with smarter 
land use decisions and housing policies, are need -
ed to provide our disadvantaged communities the 
“Ladders of Opportunity” they need to overcome 
income and transportation inequality. 
Reversing these trends will not be easy . The 
conventional solutions to Austin’s challenges are 
neither scalable nor sustainable. Even incremental 
progress will require a great many people to shift 
their assumptions and familiar ways of doing things. We need to demonstrate, in tangible 
ways, how mobility can be more accessible, safer, 
cleaner, and more affordable for all citizens. With 
the funding behind the Smart City Challenge – and 
the additional investment that we attract from 
our partners – we believe that we will be in an 
excellent position to drive this change. 
OUR FUTURE 
We intend to move Beyond Traffic  to achieve 
a future of new transportation possibilities. In 
the Austin of tomorrow, our downtown remains 
vibrant, but people no longer need to assume 
they’ll drive their own car to get there. Instead, 
they think first of on-demand automated electric 
vehicles, transit, biking, shared and on-demand 
vehicles, and other options. Prime sites once 
devoted to parking garages have redeveloped as 
mixed-use projects with homes. On the major cor -
ridors of the city, automated and electric vehicles 
and drones zip along; they interweave alongside 
personal vehicles through intersections with 
minimal need to stop and wait for a traffic light. 
These corridors connect compact “Activity Centers” 
around Austin -- cool, interesting, “Austiny” places 
where people are enjoying car-free or low-VMT 
lifestyles in walkable, mixed-use, transit-oriented 
areas. Thanks to thoughtful rezoning, new mixed-
use redevelopments have sprung up around the 
central city. People of all races, incomes, and 
ages live in them together – and enjoy choosing 
between many travel options to get to good 
jobs, good schools, live music venues, and other 
opportunities. The suburbs and exurbs feel different too . On 
the perimeter of the city, Travel Access Hubs 
bustle with activity. People drop off their personal 
vehicles, or exit trains and buses, and step into 
waiting autonomous transit and shared electric 
vehicles where they relax or check email on the 
way. Suburban commuters drop off their kids at 
an on-site daycare, grab a coffee at the coffee 
bar, and hop into an electric, automated bus that 
will whisk them to their job. Large trucks drop off 
packages and goods, which will be transported 
by small, agile automated vehicles. Low-income 
residents have access to low-cost and convenient 
mobility options that provide them access to jobs 
in any part of the city. Not only is this new mobility 
system faster and less expensive, but it is also 
much safer, since the vehicles and infrastructure 
have advanced communication and sensor tech -
nology. Private vehicles throughout the core are 
still present, they just aren’t the predominant The Mendez

The City of Austin, Texas
3 mode of travel and are only one of many choices 
each resident and visitor has to choose from.
With investment in smart transportation, this is 
a viable and possible future. The critical question 
is: “How do we get to this vision from where we 
are today?” 
The answer is:  “Make Austin, Texas the innova -
tion epicenter for introducing, testing, evaluating, 
refining, commercializing and scaling a 21st Cen -
tury Mobility System.” 
But how?  In collaboration with some of 
the world’s most innovative companies, 
cutting-edge universities, and world-renowned 
experts, the City of Austin has identified five 
immediate opportunities that will engage a 
variety of public and private partners to deliver 
enhanced mobility and economic opportunities 
for Austinites of all income groups. These 
initiatives are consistent with the ideals of 
USDOT’s Smart City Challenge and are the 
concepts which will be refined – with an eye 
towards implementation and ensuring an 
equitable distribution of benefits for all members 
of our community. 
Before we describe these initiatives, however, 
it is important to first discuss a unique and 
collaborative feature of Austin’s 21st Century 
Mobility System— Austin’s Mobility Innova -
tion Center (MIC) . The MIC is the foundation of 
our proposed Smart City network, consisting of 
four components, which will work synergistically 
to deploy our Smart City initiatives in a holistic 
and integrated fashion. AUSTIN’S MOBILITY INNOVATION 
CENTER 
The Mobility Innovation Center 
(MIC) will serve as a “Center of 
Excellence” for incubating cut -
ting-edge ideas and deploying and 
operating a 21st Century Mobility 
System. The MIC is operational; a think tank; 
an economic generator; public-facing; and most 
importantly, multi-jurisdictional. It also serves 
as project management central, 
the vehicle for managing the 
City’s Smart City effort.
A. Two-Way Open 
Data Portal
As described in Section 
9, the City of Austin 
already has an Open Data 
Portal (data.austintexas.gov). 
A 21st Century Mobility System, however, 
will generate an enormous amount of 
new and very valuable data from mo -
bility and other sectors. 
While the systems are 
one-way, the new 
transportation por -
tal, operated by the 
The University of 
Texas at Austin 
Center for Trans -
portation Research , 
will allow for accelerated open data sharing. The 
proposed two-way portal will allow data to flow 
in to and out from all partners, including both 
authoritative as well as crowdsourced data. Our 
proposed Two-Way Open Data Portal will provide 
a “one stop shop” to facilitate easy access to data 
streams that are currently siloed among many 
disparate sources and governed by fragmented 
licensing terms. These include traffic and trans -
portation information systems; users’ 
smartphones

4 (anonymous and/or opt-in); private data (such as 
third party location, weather, or schedule data); 
and transit vehicle location systems. Existing 
information will be complemented with access to 
the new and unique data elements within data 
streams associated with our Smart City initiatives. 
The Portal will: 
Be multi-dimensional, serving data consumers 
such as city traffic managers who optimize 
traffic flow and private application developers 
wishing to develop Multi-modal planning tools. 
Protect privacy and security of data through 
measures such as anonymization, especially 
for crowd-sourced consumer data from private 
companies; and
Broker agreements with private transit and 
software companies to incorporate their data 
and establish common, replicable accessibility 
and licensing practices.
B. Urban Analytics and Policy Research 
Center  – A multi-disciplinary team of profession -
als will engage in ongoing support to help us bet -
ter understand and analyze the performance data 
we collect, and model future impacts on travel 
demand. The Urban Analytics and Policy Research 
(UAPR) Center will manage the deployment of our 
planned Smart City initiatives and other projects 
and share lessons learned throughout the nation. 
As we enter a new era of unprecedented change 
in the established models for mobility, aligning 
supportive public policy and regulations is essen -
tial. We will leverage established research and 
university expertise in technology policy  (e.g., The University of Texas at Austin Center 
for Transportation Research, Texas A&M’s 
Transportation Policy Research Center, UT 
Austin’s Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public 
Affairs, and Southwest Research Institute) 
and work with technology businesses to share 
newly created knowledge with decision-makers. 
The UAPR Center will provide resources such as 
technical and analysis papers that will help poli -
cymakers understand and balance potential social 
benefits and risks in a dynamic, fast-changing 
market. This includes research to evaluate and en -
sure that these benefits are equitably distributed 
across the city’s diverse socio-economic groups.
UT Austin’s Tier 1 University Transportation 
Center for Data-Supported Transportation 
Operations and Planning (D-STOP UTC)  team 
will develop novel methods for working with the 
large-scale data coming into and out of the portal. 
They will develop applicant programming interfac -
es (API) and other tools to allow for ease of use by 
third-party companies. This partnership with the 
UTC will ensure that the work is done at the state 
of the art and that the Austin Smart City effort 
pushes the boundaries of what is possible.
Performance management is also a vital compo -
nent in our 21st Century Mobility System. Having 
an advanced data team reviewing trends and 
analyzing characteristics will help us to better 
understand important variables like defining 
a new vehicle class to represent connected/
automated vehicles, defining driver behavior pa -
rameters for the new Connected and Autonomous 
Vehicles (C/AV) class with smaller headways, and conducting sensitivity analysis for different pene -
tration levels of the C/AV class.
Through collaborative partnerships with the 
brightest public and private sector minds, the 
UAPR Center will build a foundation for a commer -
cialization cluster dedicated to sustainable growth 
and “smart” mobility innovation. 
C. Regional Operations  
Management Center
A common challenge for cities around the country 
is the fractured, isolated nature of transportation 
management – freeways are managed separately 
from arterials, state centers are independent from 
city management centers, traffic operations are 
managed independently from transit needs, etc. 
As part of our effort, Austin will launch a new 
regional operations management center (ROMC), 
at first in a virtual setting until a brick and mortar 
facility is established. The ROMC will be an oper -
ational arm of the Mobility Innovation Center, and 
the forum for multi-jurisdictional governance and 
engagement described in Section 7. It will serve 
as a unified “command center” for both traffic and 
transit operations, supervising everything from 
incident management to transit route planning 
and optimization. Working with data made 
available from the Two-Way Open Data 
Portal, ROMC personnel will optimize signal 
systems, engage existing and future traffic 
management tools, proactively communi -
cate live travel conditions and alternatives 
to travelers, and begin mainstreaming V2I 
applications as they become available.  
Operationally, the ROMC will support existing 
Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge
The City of Austin, Texas
5 functions but also provide an optimal transition 
to the 21st Century Mobility System as the home 
for the newly deployed initiatives. 
The ROMC will further function as a training 
ground for new mobility professionals as they 
graduate from local trade schools and univer -
sities – giving them first-hand experience in 
utilizing predictive, real-time, and historical data 
in pursuit of reliable and safe transportation 
throughout Austin. Finally, the ROMC will serve 
as the maintenance hub for Austin’s 21st Century 
Mobility System, monitoring the health of technol -
ogy devices, working with technicians to manage 
up-time of services and systems, and generating 
performance statistics that are the life-blood of 
ensuring long-term sustainability of the program.
D. Connected Traveler Initiative – Every user 
of Austin’s transportation network – residents, 
delivery services, visitors, etc. – will have access 
to real-time and predictive information to make 
travel decisions that work for them. The connected 
traveler also will be a source of information to 
enrich the reliability of information being dissem -
inated. Innovative companies can use this same 
data to develop new products and services that 
further serve travelers. We will also assure that 
residents and visitors who might be technology 
challenged have access to data via public systems 
such as on-street wayfinding tools, dynamic mes -
sage signs, etc.
This connected traveler initiative (CTI) will also 
serve as the interface for community engagement 
for Austin’ 21st Century Mobility System. Citizens 
can provide feedback and ideas to help influence initiatives. The public communications capability 
will include program and project websites, feed -
back and input loops such as focus groups, and 
opportunities for the public to contribute to the 
enhancement of the effort through crowdsourc -
ing. SpeakUpAustin.org (administered by the 
City’s Communications and Public Information 
Office) and MobilityATX.com (administered by a 
private organization) are two local examples of 
existing online platforms we can build upon. We 
will expand the toolkit to add features integrated 
with social media (such as Twitter and NextDoor, 
already used by the City). Promising ideas submit -
ted by the public will directly reach transportation 
engineers and planners.
AUSTIN’S 21 st CENTURY SMART CITY 
MOBILITY INITIATIVES
With the MIC serving as the platform for manage -
ment and innovation, we will launch a coordinated 
program that leverages all of the technology, inno -
vations, and forward-thinking of the leading uni -
versities, experts, and private sector companies 
right here in Austin. Each initiative synergizes and 
overlaps with the others, and is focused on mov -
ing Austin’s transportation mobility infrastructure 
systematically towards our holistic vision. Under 
the institutional, functional and operational guid -
ance of the MIC, we can deploy these initiatives, 
manage them long term, and learn from them for 
future enhancements and sharing.
Below are our five priority initiatives to be imple -
mented during the Challenge grant period and why 
they are “ready for success.”INITIATIVE #1: AUTOMATED AND 
CONNECTED VEHICLES
Consumer-Facing Deployment 
of Connected and Automated 
Mobility Services 
Goal: Implement automated 
and connected vehicles in a 
variety of settings, helping solve a number 
of mobility challenges and demonstrating 
their safe and efficient benefits to Austinites. 
With leading tech company partnerships and an 
enabling Federal, state and local regulatory envi -
ronment already in place, Austin is in a unique posi -
tion among US cities when it comes to deployment 
of connected & automated vehicles (C/AV).  This 
deployment will be coordinated with the evolving 
public transportation system, as well as bicycling 
and walking, to create a comprehensive network 
of mobility options within the region.  Since auto -
mation without connectivity won’t help us realize 
the level of safety and mobility benefit we seek, 
connectivity is a fundamental component of all 
automated elements.  Technology leaders Google 
and Car2Go (Daimler) are already “on the ground” 
in Austin, and we will further partner with leading 
private sector companies to deploy their technolo -
gy in several different environments -- considering

6 dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) and 
connectivity requirements, specific needs of the 
public, and different business models to fit each 
situation.
Airport Automated Shuttles/Circulators  
Through a partnership with Capital Metropoli -
tan Transit Authority (Capital Metro) and tech 
partners who specialize in electric-powered 
automated shuttles, and based on interest 
already expressed by the industry through an 
“Accelerate Texas”  request for interest (RFI) 
solicitation (conducted in 2015), the City of 
Austin will deploy transit circulators and smart 
infrastructure to Austin’s international airport, 
as an early testbed for future full automation 
of the Austin transit fleet. The first component 
will be a low-speed automated and connected 
shuttle that moves passengers between the 
main terminal and a new mobility hub  and 
staging area to be located in conjunction with a 
cell phone parking lot. This reduces the number 
of vehicles entering the terminal road system 
(thereby reducing congestion and pedestrian 
safety hazards), and increases the visibility and 
“comfort level” for our customers with adopting 
automated vehicles. Because of the simplified 
urban street network located wholly on airport 
property, it will provide a valuable learning 
environment for future deployments in more 
complicated urban street networks and to other 
areas like business parks and eventually in the 
future to full public transit routes including 
on-demand paratransit and transit shuttles in 
our downtown.Downtown On-Demand Automated 
Vehicle Service  Electrified, automated, 
on-demand vehicle and shuttle services have 
the potential to increase safety and reduce the 
cost of mobility. Smaller vehicles and mid-size 
transit shuttles can be used for first/last mile 
applications to enhance transit use, while 
larger transit vehicles can themselves be in -
strumented to facilitate a shift to automation of 
transit. These vehicles can be most effectively 
deployed by integrating them directly with “A 
to B” commuting solutions that are already 
being planned in downtown Austin. These 
vehicles will also benefit from connectivity 
and sensor-based infrastructure described in 
Sections 5.2 and 5.3. The City and its partners 
will closely examine access to the system to 
make sure service is available to everyone, to 
improve the lives of all Austinites, including 
those with low incomes, the elderly, and the 
disabled. Specifically, this demonstration proj -
ect will seek to bridge the jurisdictional gap 
for urban residents outside the Capital Metro 
service area that lack access to transit, despite 
their growing need. 
Urban and Suburban Automated Car 
Share Vehicles  Austin has some of the 
world’s most innovative car share and logistic 
companies, but the service areas are often 
limited to high density areas due to the logistics 
of repositioning vehicles; parking is still a chal -
lenge in the urban core; and some citizens can’t 
or won’t walk to pick up a vehicle. We seek 
to minimize these challenges by repurposing existing parking to increase the number of 
dedicated car share parking/storage oppor -
tunities, creating several specific routes that 
an automated car share vehicle could use to 
arrive at your departure point, and increasing 
the visibility of car sharing options in currently 
under-served areas. Varying levels of vehicle 
automation would be present so that once a 
driver accesses their car share vehicle they 
have an option to manually take over control 
and navigate outside the boundaries of the 
network – but being able to re-engage when 
they return to a specific area so that the car 
could drop them off at the nearest transit or 
centralized hub and then return itself to a 
nearby storage/parking facility.
Urban Package Delivery Unmanned 
Vehicles (UVs):  In exploring the concepts 
above, several private companies indicated 
an interest to pilot commercial parcel delivery 
with autonomous drones. We are open to this 
possibility and other ground and aerial  pack -
age delivery concepts as large delivery trucks 
can cause congestion in our urban core. If safe, 
reliable drones could perform last-mile delivery, 
perhaps integrating with our extensive bike 
facility network in our downtown or Mueller 
Neighborhood, they could reduce the number of 
large trucks that need to enter and navigate our 
community. Already, Whole Foods and H.E.B. 
Stores, two leading grocery corporations in 
Austin, provide free home delivery. Automat -
ing these services could likewise help travel

achieve their daily food needs.
Ready for Success:  With leading tech company 
partnerships and an enabling regulatory environ -
ment already in place, Austin is in a unique position 
among U.S. cities when it comes to deployment 
of connected & automated vehicles (C/AV). This 
deployment will be coordinated with the evolving 
public transportation system, as well as bicycling 
and walking, to create a comprehensive network 
of mobility options within the region. Technology 
leaders Google and Car2Go are already “on the 
ground” in Austin, and we will further partner 
with leading private sector companies to deploy 
their technology in several different environments, 
addressing specific needs of the public, and 
considering different business models to fit each 
situation.
INITIATIVE #2: ELECTRIC FLEETS
Electrification of 
High-Mileage Fleet Vehicles
Goal: Mainstream the accep -
tance and usage of electric 
vehicles to lower traveler costs 
and reduce emissions in the city. In order to 
accelerate proliferation of electric vehicles, Aus -
tin has identified several public mass transit and 
high-mileage vehicle fleets as the next interven -
tion point for electrification. Taxi, transportation 
network companies (TNC) like Uber and Lyft, and 
some municipal vehicles travel up to 70,000 miles 
annually. At this mileage, Electric Vehicles (EV) 
make pure economic sense due to lower operating 
costs (even with very low gasoline prices). And 
when these vehicles are eventually automated, 
we believe they will be cost-effective and conve -
nient enough to start displacing personal vehicles 
at a very high rate.
Our approach will be to provide a first of its kind 
and nationally-scalable “Fleet Electrification 
Marketplace” that connects fleet owners like 
TNC and taxi companies (many of whom have 
expressed keen interest in electrifying their fleets) 
to companies specializing in electrifying fleets 
which are just now getting off the ground. Vision 
Fleet’s Evercar and Green Wheels are having 
success with initial deployments in Los Angeles 
and Chicago and are eager to scale their business 
models to enabling environments like Austin. The 
Marketplace will clarify the value of electrification, 
help fleet owners strategically plan for adopting 
electric vehicles, provide the latest quick-charging 
infrastructure for fleet owners (and assist in plan -
ning future infrastructure), provide incentives and 
innovative finance options to mitigate some of the 
upfront purchase cost (for both EV and charging 
infrastructure), and provide education to fleet 
owners and drivers. In addition, this initiative will 
create significant community awareness by using 
a service in Austin to accelerate the adoption of 
EVs, and link EVs to public transportation, walking 
and bicycling networks to provide a suite of en -
ergy-efficient mobility choices for the community. 
Ready for Success:  With GM’s recent invest -
ment of $500 million in Lyft, we are exploring 
the possibility of deploying large numbers of GM 
electric TNC and taxi vehicles. GM’s EVs also boast state-of-the art V2V and V2Cloud technol -
ogy systems that will be very valuable to our MIC 
and other projects. Our deployments build upon 
efforts to standardize DSRC-based V2I and other 
wireless communications. EVs, especially those 
fueled by 100 percent renewable energy, can 
create an unparalleled benefit to environmental 
quality. Our utility partner, Austin Energy (a 
wholly owned agency of the City of Austin), is 
a recognized national leader in demonstrating 
clean energy generation, energy efficiency pro -
grams and electric transportation initiatives. The 
National Electric Drive Transportation Association 
and ChargePoint have recognized Austin as a top 
“plug-in ready” city in the U.S. due to infrastructure 
already installed and utility programs which signal 
our commitment to EV adoption. In addition, Capi -
tal Metro already operates several electric hybrid 
buses and is now pursuing a phased transition 
of the full fleet to sustainably powered electric 
propulsion.
INITIATIVE #3: SENSOR SYSTEMS
Intelligent, Sensor-Based 
Infrastructure
Goal:  Collect more robust data 
to make operating decisions 
and traveling decisions in real 
time.  Comprehensive and coordinated intelligent 
transportation sensors will provide robust data 
and safety information to more efficiently operate 
and maintain the mobility network and commu -
nicate with travelers to make more informed 
decisions and provide future connected vehicles 
Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge
February 2016
8 with real time information needed for guidance 
and optimized travel.
The Smart City Challenge grant will enable both 
public and private partners to advance our infra -
structure-based detection and verification net -
work to the next level by considering deployment 
of strategies such as:
Acquiring private sector data for operations 
(e.g., real-time alerts, performance monitoring, 
etc.) and to accelerate network coverage while 
reducing costs. 
Integrating rainfall sensor data, speed data and 
the traffic signal system to adjust signal timing. 
Installing temperature sensors on bridge struc -
tures for early detection of icing conditions.
Deploying detection systems to monitor pe -
destrian activity in crosswalks and dynamically 
change pedestrian clearance times.
Implementing a red light running and near-col -
lision identification system using advanced 
detection techniques at signalized intersections. 
Extending app-based services to the visually 
impaired community to navigate work zones, 
for push-button activation at signals, and for 
notification of when walk signals are displayed.
This is also an opportunity to show the intercon -
nectedness of the overall Smart City effort. By 
considering additional infrastructure-based sensor 
technology in concert with C/AV needs, and cou -
pling it with smart open data exchange protocols, 
we have an opportunity to advance the state of 
operations from both the public and private points of view. The presence of the MIC and its Two-Way 
Open Data Portal are critical components in this 
program – it’s much more than simply “hanging 
devices on poles” – it’s about 360 degree con -
sideration of devices, benefits to the citizens, and 
long term sustainability of the program. Its about 
putting the “I” in “V2I.”
Ready for Success: The City of Austin has 
already made a strong initial investment in 
intelligent sensor based detection including 
video-based detection for adaptive signal control, 
GPS-based transit signal priority on BRT corridors, 
an app-based bike detection system that provides 
trajectories/paths through the network, and low 
water crossing monitoring stations. Likewise, the 
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has 
just approved a new initiative that will re-envision 
how ITS and traffic signal control technologies can 
be integrated with roadway operations and first 
responders. Their program includes a number of 
enhancements such as a new performance-based 
and preventive maintenance programs based on 
new data collection schemes. Additionally, Capital 
Metro buses will become probes in the traffic 
stream providing information regarding position, 
travel times, schedule reliability, and passenger 
loadings.
INITIATIVE #4: TRAVEL ACCESS HUBS  
Increased Multi-modal 
Options
Goal: Put transportation 
options and access where 
people need it. We will remake 
the “park-and-ride” into a “one-stop shop” for a 
large number of mobility options including public 
transit buses, trains, car share, automated taxi/
TNC, bike share, and other services that have yet 
to be introduced.
While some existing park-and-ride facilities will 
be converted, the aim of this program is to also 
identify new locations. Hubs on the perimeter of 
the urban core will reduce single occupant VMT 
into and out of the core, while additional hubs 
beyond the perimeter will target employment 
centers and high-traffic corridors, including those 
supporting suburb-to-suburb commutes. Hubs can 
target areas underserved by transit—including 
lower-income neighborhoods – thus benefitting 
first and last mile transit solutions and even 
enabling on-demand tech-enabled automated 
mobility services. 
The mobility hub concept will extend to high ca -
pacity transit nodes in the urban core to support 
modal transfers. The hubs will also give us the 
opportunity to pilot advanced smart infrastructure 
technology like low-cost parking sensors and auto -
mated garages, advanced electric vehicle charging, 
automated on-demand car sharing and ride shar -
ing systems that are synced in real time with the 
arrival of buses and trains through advanced trip 
planning software, V2V connectivity, and more. In 
the future, a strategic network of these hubs could 
eliminate the need for human-driven vehicles in 
the urban core altogether.
Ready for Success: Austin has many well-used 
park-and-ride locations that can be outfitted with 
Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge
The City of Austin, Texas
9 sensors and transformed to include more modal 
options and connectivity.
INITIATIVE #5: PACKAGED MOBILITY 
SERVICE 
Pilot of a “One-Pass/One-App” 
Multi-modal Mobility Service 
Goal:  Make traveling on differ -
ent services effortless, with 
payments that are affordable 
and easy for travelers. We will develop a fully 
functioning service system where users access 
their customized mobility service package (e.g., 
transit, car share, ride hailing services, bike share, 
etc.) with a “one-pass and pay”’ through a single 
interface. 
The idea of “one-pass/one-app” Multmodal mo -
bility service is not new. Cities in Europe and Asia 
have implemented systems of this type success -
fully. However, the U.S. is lagging in this mobility 
arena, largely because of barriers such as the 
interoperability of data, competition among mo -
bility providers, and logistics of single-payment/
revenue sharing.
The City aims to accelerate the roll out of this type 
of service in the U.S. by piloting a “one-pass/one-
app” program despite the barriers listed above. It 
will be a fully functioning service system where 
users access their customized mobility service 
package (e.g., transit, car share, ride hailing ser -
vices, bike share, etc.) with a single pass, paying 
for services through a single account. We want to 
see how the system would work with real people 
to demonstrate its value and grow the market size 
of this type of service. Capital Metro already has 
efforts underway in this space. RideScout, an Aus -
tin-born transportation technology and transporta -
tion aggregator company, chose Austin specifically 
for its early adoption of innovative transportation 
options like bike share, car share, and ride hailing 
services and opportunities to deploy a seamless 
payment system across modes.
Ready for Success: Capital Metro, RideScout 
and others are already working on solving mobil -
ity service interoperability, and connectivity for 
Austin.
MOVING BEYOND TRAFFIC
As Austin’s Smart City Challenge Grant proposal 
demonstrates, our vision and our initiatives are 
consistent with USDOT’s goals for our Nation to 
move Beyond Traffic, placing a priority on improv -
ing safety, enhancing mobility, and addressing 
climate change. With the implementation of Aus -
tin’s Smart City vision, we will be able to positively 
address the following:
How We Will Move  – Our proposed Smart 
City initiatives and complementary land use 
strategies strive to optimize Austin’s existing 
transportation infrastructure, rather than at -
tempt to build our way out of congestion. Our 
Travel Access Hubs  will be a place to match 
individuals with unused passenger capacity, 
TNCs, and new bike and car share opportunities, 
thus reducing single occupancy vehicle travel 
and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our 
Packaged Mobility Service provides users with 
options for trip-making without an automobile – critical for low-income households that are 
disproportionately burdened by transportation 
costs. Even our C/AV deployment contemplates 
rolling stock of different sizes to accommodate 
different markets and car share opportunities. 
Underlying all of it, the City’s recently adopt -
ed Imagine Austin Comprehensive Plan and 
CodeNext development regulations provide 
for the densification of new development and 
promote a non-car dependent quality of life.
How We Will Move Things – While the 
focus of our Smart City initiatives is the move -
ment of people, the City of Austin understands 
that Smart Cities of the future will also need to 
develop technologies and strategies to handle 
urban freight delivery more efficiently and ef -
fectively. Our 21st Century Mobility System will 
address, through pilot testing and implementa -
tion, several issues related to freight delivery 
for commercial businesses and individuals 
within the city. With ridesharing and intelligent 
traffic management contributing to less con -
gestion, traditional freight shipments will move 
through Austin more quickly and safely than 
ever before. The exploration of other innovative 
freight strategies and solutions will be a part of 
the next stage of Austin’s Smart City concept 
refinement. 
How We Will Move Better – The City 
and its partners are driven by the desire for 
continuous improvement. The proposed MIC 
will serve as the vehicle for how Austinites 
– and eventually all urban Americans – will 
move better. The Urban Analytics and Policy 
Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge
February 2016
10 Research Center is our think tank, bringing 
together experts from the public, private, and 
academic sectors to cultivate new ideas and 
technologies, with a commitment to advanc -
ing transportation as a ladder of opportunity 
and an eye on commercialization. The MIC’s 
Regional Operations Management Center 
will implement the deployment of Smart City 
initiatives – the first step towards experiencing 
improved mobility – and monitor and evaluate 
their performance. The MIC – indeed Austin’s 
entire Smart City effort – is supported by a 
foundation of rich, open source data managed 
through a Two-Way Open Data Portal. 
How We Will Adapt – Austin is actively 
engaged in reducing and reversing the nega -
tive climate change impacts associated with 
urban sprawl and an overly auto-dependent 
population. The City Council approved Austin 
Community Climate Plan, authored by its Office 
of Sustainability, which sets a long-term net 
zero community wide greenhouse gas emission 
goal by the year 2050. Our Smart City concepts 
fully align with the City’s proposed solutions to 
achieve this goal. In 2015, Austin produced the 
Central Texas Extreme Weather and Climate 
Change Vulnerability Assessment of Regional 
Transportation Infrastructure report which has 
identified critical resiliency needs and vulnera -
ble areas and assets in the city’s transportation 
network, and has provided possible solutions 
for agencies citywide to collectively pursue. The City’s CodeNext land use regulation pro -
cess emphasizes the need for compact and 
connected development, minimizing sprawl 
and the reliance on automobiles, while further 
supporting resilient and sustainable land use. 
How We Will Align Decisions and Dollars  
– Working closely with our public and private 
partners, Austin will continue to prioritize 
transportation investments based on the most 
critical needs of residents as defined by the 
eight priorities set in Austin’s comprehensive 
plan, Imagine Austin, such as providing low-in -
come residents transit oriented affordable 
housing and increased transportation options 
to access the workforce. If selected as a Smart 
City Challenge finalist, the next phase of the 
application process will define a prioritization 
plan and schedule for the implementation of 
our proposed initiatives, as well as outline how 
these projects will meet the objectives already 
identified our comprehensive plan.
As our Smart City Challenge proposal demon -
strates, we have already established strong 
partnerships with cutting-edge research and 
technology entities, and have made the founda -
tional investments in technology infrastructure 
that make us “ready” for this extraordinary grant 
opportunity. With the help of the Smart City 
Challenge grant and the anticipated financial 
investment from our partners that the grant will 
unlock, Austin looks forward to being the U.S.’s 
first true Smart City of the 21st Century.2. POPULATION 
CHARACTERISTICS
The City of Austin is a mid-size city with a popu -
lation of 790,390 inhabitants (as of the 2010 U.S. 
Census). Austin is an urban city with 83 percent 
of the city’s land area located in the Austin urban -
ized area (UZA) and 2,653 people per square mile 
across the Census Designated Place (CDP) land 
area. The City of Austin’s population accounts for 
58 percent of the UZA.

Capital Metro is a full and enthusiastic partner 
in all aspects of the proposed MIC and its Smart 
City initiatives. Capital Metro serves Austin and 
is already innovating in Smart City ways: the 
agency has established a goal to fully electrify its 
fleet; has executed partnerships with technology 
companies specializing in flexible, real-time route 
planning, mobile ticketing, and ride sharing; and 
has plans underway to deploy automated vehicles 
into its fleet. Section 8 provides more details on 
Capital Metro’s current services.

The City of Austin, Texas
11 Hacon, Bytemark, RideScout and others. South by 
Southwest Interactive, among other Austin events, 
provides a globally watched forum for sharing 
demonstration project innovations with other cit -
ies and agencies. As discussed in Section 1, Austin 
also has an outsized presence in the investment 
and startup community. The City is recognized as 
a third center, after Boston and San Francisco, for 
Angel/VC investment in innovation and startup 
companies.As a business environment, Austin consistently 
ranks #1 or high up on virtually every “Top 10 
Cities” list. Forbes magazine this month named 
Austin “America’s next boomtown.” The recently 
published Dell Future Ready Economies Model 
projects that Austin will be one of the nation’s 
fastest growing city economies over the next five 
to 10 years. Austinites are famously open-minded, 
and eco-conscious early adopters – providing an 
ideal base of mobility service consumers with 
which to pilot innovative new ideas that require 
individuals to try new ways of getting around the 
city. 
3.c Continuity of committed leadership and 
capacity to carry out the demonstration 
throughout the period of performance
Mayor Steve Adler, who began a four-year term 
in 2015, ran on a platform of improving transpor -
tation in Austin. The USDOT Smart City Challenge 
has been embraced by the Mayor and City Council 
as an ideal fit with their two top policy priorities: 
transportation and affordability. City Manager 
Marc Ott, Capital Metro President and CEO Linda 
Watson and their executive teams (and the leader -
ship teams of the Core Team partners identified in 
Section 7) have pledged their full commitment to 
the project throughout its period of performance. 
To provide continuity independent of political 
cycles, an “Austin Smart City Consortium” will 
be established with a Joint Executive Team (JET) 
and dedicated full-time staff to oversee imple -
menting the Smart City project; the Consortium is 
described in Section 7. This structure will provide 
for stability, expanded capacity, nimbleness ,and continuity not only for the three-year USDOT Chal -
lenge period but beyond, to carry on implementing 
future projects. Our many stable, established 
partners will ensure both continuity and capacity. 
Austin is investing in this for the long haul and 
has already started down the path towards a new 
smart mobility system. Our big-picture goal is to 
launch a whole new economic sector in Austin in 
addition to solving our transportation challenges, 
give residents a range of safe and automated 
mobility choices, and improve our environment 
through electrification of our region’s fleets.
3.d Commitment to integrating with the 
sharing economy 
Austinites are enthusiastic participants in the 
sharing economy; it’s the corporate home of Ho -
meAway and a top AirBnB city as well. Austin is 
the fastest-growing market for TNCs in the nation; 
Austinites have embraced not only Uber, Lyft and 
GetMe, but newer app-based peer-to-peer vehicle 
sharing services such as BuddyTruk and FlightCar. 
Both ZipCar and Car2Go maintain active and large 
Austin fleets. It’s no surprise that Austin is cited 
as a model in the National League of Cities report, 
“Cities, the Sharing Economy, and What’s Next.” 
Due to the explosive growth of TNC utilization, 
elected officials have been developing a protocol 
to provide enhanced safety for Austin users. Uber, 
Lyft, and GetMe have expressed interest in partic -
ipating in our Smart City effort, and we welcome 
the opportunity to continue working closely with 
TNCs.Capital Metro  recognizes that in an age of 
automated vehicles and big data, urban tran -
sit agencies need to innovate. Its leadership 
is prepared to embrace electrified, automat -
ed, on-demand vehicle services with flexible 
routing. Elements of the Smart City Chal -
lenge that Capital Metro transit is excited to 
join include: 
New airport “circulators” and smart applica -
tions that pilot consumer-facing, automated 
public transit.
New agreements with private transit and 
software companies.
Future automated public transit that can 
increase service frequency, service area, 
and route flexibility.
Transit route optimization and the new 
Mobility HUBs.
Developing seamless connectivity between 
transit and on-demand, tech-enabled, auto -
mated mobility services.

12  3.e Clear commitment to making open, 
machine-readable data 
As a tech innovation center, Austin is already 
deeply engaged with open data. As described in 
Sections 1 and 9, the enhancement of our existing 
Open Data Portal is a major initiative within the 
proposed MIC. It will serve as a regional, two-way 
open data center “warehouse.”
The effort builds upon the City of Austin’s existing 
municipal open data portal which utilizes the 
platform Socrata. This open government resource 
offers the public data sets, downloads and APIs. 
The portal is enhanced for smartphone use, and 
intended to improve both accessible government 
and private sector innovation and collaboration. It 
also maintains an open government platform, Aus -
tinGo. Austin Finance Online is an award-winning 
tool that allows citizens to access city financial Austin’s Open Data Initiatives

to further engage civic tech transparency and 
growth. 
ATX Hack For Change – Hosts events using 
open data to develop innovative community 
based solutions. Projects have included local 
bus, bike, and walking travel apps. and purchasing data. The City remains actively 
engaged in a national dialogue on standards for 
municipal open data initiatives. 
Capital Metro already shares both static data in 
General Transit Static Feed Specification (GTFS) 
format and its real-time (RT) fleet information 
(in GTFS-RT format) on state and city open data 
portals, as well as its own website. This data 
has allowed mobile ticketing through a partner -
ship with Bytemark and a head start toward a 
next-generation Multi-modal trip planning and 
payment tool currently in development through a 
partnership with Hacon. 
Our Smart City Challenge partner, the Center for 
Transportation Research at UT Austin, is already 
working with the City to develop an open data 
project, the “Data Discovery Environment.” It 
allows sharing of Central Texas real-time and 
historical trip and traffic data (from the City 
and Capital Metro), and provides a framework 
for using big data to help transportation agency 
staff and decision makers. The data platform is 
web-based and the project includes developing 
appropriate protocols for access and governance. 
This will give us a huge Smart City head start on 
the proposed MIC’s Two-Way Open Data Portal.

45. SMART CITY 
VISION ELEMENTS 
Austin’s MIC will serve as a focal point for deploy -
ment and coordination of all aspects of our Smart 
City Challenge initiatives – current and future. We 
share USDOT’s vision of a successful Smart City 
and understand that only through a combination 
of a) cutting edge technology; b) innovative ap -
proaches to urban transportation development 
and delivery; and c) “smart” architecture, commu -
nication, and land use can this vision be achieved. 
We have developed our proposed initiatives 
accordingly. The following sections and table 
describe how Austin’s Smart City vision aligns 
with USDOT’s 12 vision elements for a truly Smart 
City – and a 21st Century Mobility System. 
5.1 URBAN AUTOMATION 
The safe, optimized introduction of urban automa -
tion is a cornerstone element of our application. 
Clearly, our Autonomous and Connected Vehicle 
Services initiative is a multi-dimensional effort to 
deploy urban automation boldly and safely in order 
to pave the way for proliferation of automated 
vehicle services across the nation. In addition, 
Travel Access Hubs  will serve as physical (and 
visible) epicenters for the introduction of urban 
automation.
With an eye beyond our initial deployments, the 
MIC will monitor and iterate our efforts related to 
urban automation. The technology and business 
models are evolving so rapidly that we need to

The City of Austin, Texas
13 remain agile and continue to learn from 
and replicate our efforts to ensure optimal 
deployment of urban automation.
5.2 CONNECTED VEHICLES 
As we implement electric and automated 
vehicle projects throughout Austin, we will 
enhance their benefits through advanced 
connected vehicle applications. Connectivity 
(V2X) will help us realize the level of safety 
and mobility benefit we seek, and thus it is 
a fundamental component of our approach.
We will work with companies like Google 
and Daimler, along with Savari (DSRC) and 
NAUTO (V2Cloud) that make aftermarket 
systems that can be installed in existing 
vehicles. We will then be able to test DSRC, 
3G/4G/5G, cellular Wi-Fi, Satellite (XM Siri -
us) and other V2X technologies side-by-side 
to demonstrate that devices from various 
suppliers are interoperable and that various 
communication technologies can coexist 
without harmful interference, particularly Table 1: MIC’s Fulfillment of

and analyze performance data so that we can 
continually improve the system and make relevant 
data available to innovators.
We will work with emerging companies that re -
sponded to the  Accelerate Texas Request For 
Interest (RFI) to deploy technologies already being 
tested in other parts of the world here in Austin, 
exposing our community of early adopters and 
tech industries to the opportunities and realities 
presented by electrification and automation.
5.3 INTELLIGENT SENSOR-BASED 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
A key element in Austin’s 21st Century Mo -
bility System is awareness. With the advent 
of sensor-equipped vehicles, automakers are 
implementing systems that use these sensors 
to warn drivers of vulnerable road users, such as 
pedestrians, construction workers, and cyclists. Project Highlight
In our Sensor Systems proj -
ect, we intend to leverage 
ongoing projects by City of Austin and TxDOT through the introduction of several 
additional and new sensor programs to further 
enrich our data sets and open the door to new and innovative applications.
Unfortunately, these onboard sensors are some -
times occluded from directly sensing the vulner -
able road users due to buildings, other vehicles, 
and intersection geometries – or simply lack the 
depth of full system awareness with other vehi -
cles, pedestrians, and road geometry. Intelligent, 
infrastructure-based sensing can fill in these gaps, 
and in many cases can be more robust, utilizing 
higher-end sensors and processors than can be 
accommodated on a vehicle.
Our program will focus on adding infrastruc -
ture-based detection technology at strategic 
positions near highly-dynamic intersections and 
transit stops. The data from these sensors will 
be analyzed in real-time by detection and clas -
sification algorithms to identify key objects of 
interest – and leveraging infrastructure-to-vehicle 
communication, such as (DSRC), the data will be 
transmitted to connected vehicles for use in V2V 
and V2I applications. Whether human-driven or 
automated, these connected vehicles will benefit 
from the shared situational awareness provided 
by the infrastructure. Furthermore, the infrastruc -
ture’s ability to collect new, unique data from connected vehicles ties the vehicle, infrastructure 
and data analytics together.
5.4 URBAN ANALYTICS
A critical aspect of Austin’s Autonomous and 
Connected Vehicles initiative is coordinating the 
deployment of such vehicles with the evolving 
public transportation system, car share/car pool/
van pool networks, as well as bicycling and walk -
ing, to create a robust network of mobility for the 
region. 
The MIC features an Urban Analytics and Policy 
Research Center which will serve as Austin’s 
primary vehicle for analyzing Smart City data. 
The data from MIC’s Regional Operations and 
Management Center will be used to improve 
real-time traffic management, transit operations 
and traveler communication to reduce the effect 
of traffic incidents in the City. This real-time 
application of data can also be used to facilitate 
the use of automated and connected vehicles on 
arterials and highways. The integrated nature of 
the MIC’s multiple functions lends itself to the Project Highlight
Our Urban Analytics and Policy 
Research component of the MIC can also help us better understand, analyze, and 
model future impacts on travel demand.  By 
reviewing trends and analyzing characteristics 
we will define a new vehicle class to represent 
C/AVs, and conduct a sensitivity analysis for 
different penetration levels of the C/AV class.
Project Highlight
 In the Airport Automated Shuttles/
Circulators component of our Au -
tomated and Connected Vehicles 
project, we have a unique opportu -
nity to utilize CV technology in the 
electric automated vehicles to help with any 
intersection crossing or interaction and transit 
stop safety or conflicts with human-driven 
vehicles, to present real-time car location to 
patrons waiting in the cell phone lot, and to 
react or respond during differing weather or 
environmental conditions.
Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge
February 2016
16 for technologically Smart Cities to develop plans 
for managing UAV traffic within the urban core 
and for distribution of packages delivered in this 
manner is still urgent. Likewise, the use of small 
automated low-speed electric ground vehicles 
could also be considered for package delivery, 
perhaps operating safely and conveniently within 
Austin’s extensive bike network. 
As our effort progresses we will seek out methods 
for accommodating UAV- & autonomous low-
speed vehicle based deliveries while preserving 
public safety through proper interface with V2I/
V2V systems, ensuring security of the packages 
and citizens, and to limit the potential for UAV 
failure or collisions. 
5.7 STRATEGIC BUSINESS MODELS AND 
PARTNERING 
The City of Austin has a proven track record in 
partnering with the public and private sector on 
innovative transportation initiatives. We see our 
partners as being both technology innovators 
wanting to improve the transportation system 
in the Austin area and employers who wish to 
expand mobility options for their employees. 
As just one example of a strategic partnership to 
advance Smart City concepts, the City and the 
Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) are working over 
the next several years to develop innovative mo -
bility solutions emerging from local and national 
businesses, industry leaders, and entrepreneurs. 
The program through its Urban Analytics Initiative 
will improve the information available to the 
public through mobility apps and other data optimization and sharing techniques critical 
to the creation – and sustainability – of Smart 
Cities. 
5.5 USER-FOCUSED MOBILITY SERVICES 
AND CHOICES 
Our Packaged Mobility (one-card/one-app) Ser -
vice is specifically designed to provide mobility 
choices to all Austinites and visitors. We believe 
that seamless integration of multiple modes of 
public transportation, combined with compact 
and connected land use and automated vehicles 
will decrease dependence on personal vehicles 
and increase walking, biking, shared vehicle and 
transit use.
Likewise, the creation of Travel Access Hubs  
will create the physical epicenters for citizen en -
gagement with the 21st Century Mobility System. 
These hubs are envisioned as great public spaces 
where users can connect to many transportation 
options, co-working spaces, and other travel 
amenities such as showers and lockers for cyclists. 
Using dynamic parking pricing and new parking Project Highlight
A cornerstone of Austin’s vision 
is a mobility subscription, or “Mo -
bility as a Service” - the idea that 
users should be able to purchase 
a package of mobility options including transit, 
bike, car sharing, and ridesharing, as well as 
critical services to enable a nearly car-free life -
style such as grocery delivery in a prepackaged 
smartphone app or card. 
management tools, the limited automotive space 
at these hubs will be prioritized for car sharing, 
vanpooling, and rideshare or automated vehicle 
pick-up and drop-off. Designed to make travel 
sustainable and easy, these transportation hubs 
would be a national model for connecting people 
and places.
5.6 URBAN DELIVERY AND LOGISTICS 
Austin’s 21st Century Mobility System will address, 
through pilot testing and implementation, several 
issues related to freight delivery for commercial 
businesses and individuals within the urbanized 
core of the city. Several large package delivery 
corporations are testing a variety of automated 
vehicle types for potential delivery of small- to 
medium-sized packages with implementation hori -
zons as short as 3-5 years. FAA is still considering 
how it will regulate or restrict general airspace to 
the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); while 
the number and/or level to which such deliveries 
will become commonplace is unknown, the need 
Project Highlight
The Urban Package Delivery compo -
nent of our Automated & Connected 
Vehicles initiative is made possible 
thanks to several private companies 
who indicate an interest to pilot 
commercial parcel delivery with autonomous 
drones. If proven safe, reliable drones could 
perform “last mile” delivery, and we could 
reduce the number of large trucks that need 
to enter and navigate our city.

17 technologies. This will help people know what 
their options are when they are deciding how they 
want to get somewhere.
5.8 SMART GRID, ROADWAY 
ELECTRIFICATION, AND ELECTRIC 
VEHICLES 
Our Electric Fleets initiative is aimed at eliminating 
the barriers to widespread electric vehicle prolif -
eration. This initiative will enable and incentivize 
electric vehicle adoption by high-mileage fleets 
through innovative business models and financing. 
In addition, we will deploy charging infrastructure 
intelligently and effectively to support our fleet 
work and encourage consumer adoption of electric 
vehicles as well. 
Austin also owns and operates its own interna -
tional airport. As such, we control the operating 
parameters of the taxi and transportation network 
fleets that have access to passengers arriving at Project Highlight
The City of Austin and the Texas 
A&M Transportation Institute (TTI)

for mobility & safety applications.
the port. We believe we can affect a rapid con -
version of these fleets to electric modes of travel 
through education, incentives, and infrastructure.
Federal investment has been critical to removing 
barriers to EV adoption and has directly supported 
an effective and diverse EV advisory group across 
utilities, academia, government, and private indus -
try. The City values its Federal partnerships, and 
especially looks forward to partnering with USDOT 
to continue to advance – and implement - its 
Smart City vision.
 5.9 CONNECTED, INVOLVED CITIZENS
Through this Connected Traveler Initiative, we 
will engage diverse community voices – traveler 
input will be an R&D resource – and cultivate 
partners in mobility change. Austinites will not 
hesitate to voice their views and contribute to 
decisions that directly affect them. To ensure Project Highlight
Austin’s public and fleet EV 
charging stations are powered by 
100% green-e certified renewable 
energy credits, so each electric 
vehicle mile traveled displaces the maximum 
CO2, oil-dependence, and pollution of a gaso -
line mile. Austin is the ideal city to show that 
electric vehicles can affordably run on wind 
and sun power. Low, fixed charging costs - just 
$4.17 per month (Austin Energy also provides 
charging station rebates) - greatly improves the 
business case for electric vehicles independent 
of current gasoline cost.

cesses as part of all the systems and applications 
developed through the partnership. The Austin 
partnership is committed to developing applica -

viable standards and architectures do not exist, 
the partnership is committed to documenting the 
situations and circumstances as to why current 
standards and architectures were insufficient to 
permit the desired functionality. 
The Austin partnership plans to follow standard 
system engineering practices and utilize tools 
such as the CVRIA, SET-IT and others to docu -
ment planned and deployed systems. Critical to 
this will be documenting the interfaces and data 
exchanges required to integrate projects with 
existing traffic management and data manage -
ment functions currently deployed in the Austin 
area. As we pursue opportunities with original 
equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and vehicle and device manufacturers to build our V2V and 
V2I applications, it is critical they are built from 
a platform that supports the safety, mobility, and 
environmental applications developed by USDOT 
sponsored research and complies with the stan -
dards and requirements referenced in the NHTSA 
Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to 
create Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 
(FMVSS) 150 to require DSRC technology in future 
vehicles for V2V Safety.
5.11 LOW-COST, EFFICIENT, SECURE, AND 
RESILIENT ICT
While the City’s existing Information and Commu -
nication Technology Infrastructure (as introduced 
in Section 3) provides a solid foundation, this 
program will make it necessary to integrate new 
connected, automated, and electrified technolo -
gies; intelligent infrastructure; a data repository; 
USDOT’s Security Credential Management 
System (SCMS); and other existing back-end sys -
tems that support new mobility and environment 
applications. Our IC T will feature a Smart City 
architecture that integrates information from a 
variety of sources and a mixture of communication 
mediums.
Plans for communication security, physical securi -
ty, and device access control will be developed to 
comply with all federal standards and to include 
the latest technologies. As part of our collabora -
tive environment, we will seek mutually beneficial 
opportunities to partner vehicle and device suppli -
ers with IT service providers who provide proven 
technology which seamlessly switches between Project Highlight

To better help real people, our Smart City tech 
innovations must be focused on connecting key 
places and supporting denser, walkable, transit/
mobility-oriented new development in areas with 
jobs and affordable homes. That same focus will 
lower our carbon footprint.  Fortunately, Austin 
has recently laid the foundation with the plans and 
policies needed to achieve this shift. They call for 
redirecting our city’s rapid growth into compact 
areas and “activity centers” – which need rich 
mobility links. The City’s 2012 Imagine Austin

8.c Existing Transit Services 
Capital Metro operates Austin’s public transpor -
tation network. In 2015, this network provided 1.4 
million revenue hours of service, utilizing 398 bus -
es, 40 MetroRapid BRT vehicles, 167 paratransit 
vehicles, and 6 diesel multiple unit rail vehicles. 
Riders have access to 2,700 bus stops, 20 transit 
centers, and 9 commuter rail stations. 
Austin’s public transportation technology infra -
structure strongly aligns with the characteristics 
of an ideal Smart City. The City and Capital Metro 
have an impressive history of collaborating with 
each other to provide riders with the most intel -
ligent transportation system possible. Capital 
Metro was the only transit agency in the nation 
to be named as a Premier Technology Leader in 
2016 by Computerworld. 
Austin’s public transit mobile ticketing app was 
one of the first of its kind in the nation and has 
won multiple local, state, and national awards. 
The app allows riders to purchase tickets on any 
of Capital Metro’s bus, rail, or paratransit services 
and to store them on their smart phones. The City 
of Austin and Capital Metro worked together to 
implement the infrastructure required to support 
transit signal priority allowing BRT (MetroRapid) 
routes through center-to-center communications. 
The combination of availability of real-time AVL 
data via Capital Metro’s website, mobile app, 
dynamic message signs, and open data portals 
and advanced mobile to mobile application public chair of the JET; manages private sector in -
volvement; and serves as the point of contact to 
USDOT. An executive of the City of Austin and 
transportation professional – will be assigned 
this role and serve as the full-time Consortium 
Executive Director. The Director and the overall 
Smart City program will be supported by an 
experienced program management firm (e.g., 
reporting, budgeting, performance manage -
ment, compliance, etc.) including a premiere 
data management firm to support the data 
infrastructure needs of our partners. 
The Consortium will be staffed by project and 
initiative managers who oversee the day-to-day 
aspects of our Smart City effort; monitor and mea -
sure performance; and prepare draft deliverables. 
Managers are expected to be senior staff from the 
Core Team and Key Partners.

Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge
The City of Austin, Texas
23 In 1993, the multi-agency Greater Austin Area 
Telecommunications Network (GAATN) was cre -
ated. GAATN is a network that connects more 
than 400 partner agency sites via 339 miles of 
fiber optic cables. In 2002, GAATN received a 
“Best of Texas” award from the Center for Digital 
Government and Government Technology maga -
zine. In 2011, GAATN was named recipient of the 
Community Broadband Organization of the Year 
award by the National Association of Telecom -
munications Officers and Advisors.
Completed in 2003, the Combined Transportation, 
Emergency Communications Center (CTECC) is a 
partnership of the City of Austin, Travis County, 
TxDOT and Capital Metro. CTECC is the current 
location of TxDOT’s intelligent transportation sys -
tems for the Austin area. Roadway traffic sensor 
and camera information arrive at CTECC via a 
dedicated network and this information is used for 
daily operations by transportation management 
staff and public safety agencies. CTECC is also 
one of six ‘super ring’ sites on the GAATN allowing 
for ease of network interconnection.
Complementing this infrastructure is the fiber 
optic network operated by ATD that connects 
nearly every signalized intersection in Austin to 
an existing transportation management center. 
The ATD network is currently being analyzed to 
determine the best approach for updating the 
network to use the same software that is used by 
TxDOT so that these two systems can exchange 
information with the long term goal of seamless 
message exchange between ATD and TxDOT via the proposed Regional Operations Management 
Center.
Finally, a fiber optic network, operated and main -
tained by TxDOT along major highways (i.e., IH35, 
US183, US290, SH130, SH71, and Loop 1) in the 
Austin area serves as a communications backbone 
network for connected transportation.
8.f ITS Including Transportation Manage -
ment Center and Field Equipment
The Austin region has multiple, independent trans -
portation management centers (TMCs) operated 
by various entities including the City of Austin, 
TxDOT, CTRMA, Capital Metro and others. Each 
TMC operates independently with its own set 
of standard operating procedures, performance 
metrics, and overall goals focused on their users. 
Through regional collaboration, Austin and its 
partners are addressing this “siloed” operational 
approach through the development of the ROMC 
component of the MIC. As described in Section 
1, the ROMC would take a holistic “One System” 
approach to managing the region’s transportation 
system. Creating a “One System, One Vision” 
approach leverages the expertise and resources 
of each entity to create an operational approach 
whose sum is much greater than the individual 
parts. This shifts the paradigm to improving mo -
bility of all users regardless of the facility they are 
traveling along. Multi-agency staff would be locat -
ed at the ROMC and coordinate through common 
operating objectives and integrated technology 
and data platforms. The ROMC provides a great 
opportunity to improve incident management, reduce recurring congestion, increase safety, 
and leverage existing resources to a scale that is 
greater than that achieved by individual agencies.
8.g Smart Grid Infrastructure 
Austin Energy is the nation’s 8th largest publicly 
owned electric utility serving more than 448 thou -
sand customer accounts and more than 1 million 
residents in greater Austin. During peak demand, 
Austin Energy manages 2,714 megawatts (MW), 
57 MW of reduction assets, and 3,485 MW of 
generation capacity which consists of 28.5 per -
cent renewables. Austin Energy is responsible for 
623 miles of transmission lines and 11,429 miles 
of distribution lines on Austin’s electric grid. Op -
erations are funded entirely through energy sales 
and services, and the utility operates within the 
Electric Reliability Council of Texas statewide 
market. 
Highlights of this innovative utility, beyond tradi -
tional electric service operations, include:
Austin Energy Green Building — Austin En -
ergy launched the first Green Building program 
in the nation; more than 10,000 Austin homes 
are Green Building rated.
Climate Protection  — The 2014 update to 
the Generation, Resource and Climate Protec -
tion Plan envisions Austin Energy achieving a 
55 percent renewable energy supply by 2025.
Energy Efficiency  — Through Austin En -
ergy’s energy efficiency achievements, the 
utility has been able to save 700 MW from 
1982–2006. An additional 900 MW energy 
avoidance goal has been set for 2025, and as 
Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge
February 2016
24 of 2013, we have already avoided 376 MW 
toward that goal.
Energy Efficiency Rebates  — In FY 2013, 
more than 35,000 energy efficiency improve -
ment rebates totaling about $11 million were 
paid to Austin Energy customers.
Dark Sky Compliant Streetlights  — Austin 
Energy continues to find ways to become a 
more efficient utility including automating its 
56,000 streetlights and making them Dark Sky 
compliant. Austin Energy also converted more 
than 13,000 streetlights to light emitting diode 
technology. The automation and LED projects 
are expected to save more than 4.3 million 
kilowatts annually.
Electric Vehicle Charging Stations  — Aus -
tin ranks among the top four cities in the nation 
for electric vehicle public charging stations. In 
FY 2015, the Plug-In EVerywhere™ Network 
surpassed its 100,000th session.
9. DEFINE EXISTING 
DATA COLLECTION
The City of Austin has a robust data collection 
program and therefore a rich foundation of data 
to support implementation of our Smart City vision. 
Austin and its partners are data -driven, out -
come-focused, and believe that data is an asset 
that has value in improving how a city (transpor -
tation infrastructure, transit, public safety, etc.) is 
managed and operated. 
9Data’s Value in Managing a City 
(data driven decisions)
Austin is working on a number of exciting 
efforts to share data with businesses to im -
prove and create services for their customers 
while simultaneously benefiting the community 
through reduced congestion, improved safety 
and less environmental impacts. For example, 
today, the City’s low water crossing data is 
being consumed by Metropia – a company 
that provides incentive-based navigation ser -
vices. When a low water crossing is blocked, 
Metropia’s app routes traffic around the 
crossing reducing congestion and frustration 
for their users. Building on this success, early 
discussions are underway with Metropia to share the City’s reduced speed school zone data. Access to this data enables Metropia to alert their customers when they need to 
begin slowing down and can also be used to 
divert traffic away from the school zone further 
enhancing safety. Austin’s data cache to support its Smart City 
vision is too large to list in this proposal. A few 
examples of relevant data include travel times, 
reliability, signal timing, transit vehicle locations, 
transit schedule adherence, passenger loadings, 
managed parking transaction and occupancy, 
video, air quality, weather, crash statistics, field 
equipment status, and incident characteristics. 
Austin’s commitment to open data is exemplified 
by City Manager Marc Ott’s Open Data Initiative 
2.0 directive that “with the development of new 
technologies and an increasingly connected and 
engaged population, a growing expectation is 
being placed on government leaders to promote 
transparency, citizen participation, and collabora -
tion.”
Beyond its existing data program, Austin is re -
making the face of urban analytics. Austin is in 
the process of bringing these resources together 
through its Urban Analytics Initiative (UAI) to en -
able the broader transportation community (and 
others) to take advantage of the latent potential 
of this dynamic ecosystem. The mission of the UAI 
is to foster interagency and interdisciplinary col -
laboration, promote synergy between the public, 
private, and academic sectors, and to engage the Austin community with a focus on high-impact 
applications that address city challenges across 
all sectors – transportation, safety, environmental,

25 affordability, and a host of others. The UAI is an 
integral aspect of the MIC’s Urban Analytics Policy 
Research (UAPR) Center element.
In brief, the UAI will lead to data integration 
across functions and services by: (1) fostering a 
data sharing culture; (2) using real-time data to 
make real-time agency operations and staffing 
decisions; (3) discovering relationships among 
different data sets that can lead to improved 
decisions regarding management and operations; 
(4) documenting benefits of data integration. As 
Figure 4  shows, data across a variety of functions 
and services are compiled in a common database, 
accessible to a number of sectors. Analytics are 
performed, and information is generated to make 
management and operations decisions across a 
range of time frames. We believe that the out -
come of UAI will be more integrated Multi-modal 
programs and more rapid decisions. Section 11 
of this proposal further describes how data will 
inform the measurement of Smart City goals and 
objectives.
Performance measures are the ‘face’ and the 
‘guts’ of the system. Real-time reporting aids trip 
decisions; daily reporting facilitiates changes to 
agency operations; and monthly and quarterly 
reporting helps identify the need for investments 
and policy changes. Data policies and agreements 
among data providers and users will need to be 
developed through the UAI to address data col -
lection, management, sharing, storage, archiving, 
security, and privacy issues. It is likely that these 
policies will require some degree of customi -
zation to address different data types and the requirements of different data providers. Data 
handling procedures will be programmed into the 
system to the extent possible to minimize inad -
vertent data policy violations. Data policy audits 
will be performed at regular intervals by an inde -
pendent entity. The UAI will also develop (1) tools 
to identify data integrity issues (gaps, significant 
deviations) and (2) procedures to flag issues and 
when appropriate resolve issues. 
10. ITS AND 
CONNECTED VEHICLE 
STANDARDS
Austin is committed to deploying applications and 
systems where the interfaces and the data trans -
ferred between the systems are open and flexible 
to all developers and users of the system. To the 
extent possible, the City is committed to using 
existing standards, protocols, and architectures 
in the development of applications and systems. 
A sample of these is highlighted to the right of 
this page. 
In those cases where existing standards are 
inadequate or incomplete to support the desired 
functionality, Austin will prepare appropriate 
documentation of the standard’s deficiencies 
that will be introduced to standard development 
organizations, such as SAE, IEEE, ITE, and others 
to develop new or revise appropriate standards for 
the benefit of other cities across the nation. 
10Implementation of the MIC and its subsequent 
initiatives will be designed to integrate with the 
current and planned ITS architecture in the region. 
In June 2015, the Austin region completed an 
update to its ITS Architecture which documented 
existing and planned ITS deployments. This archi -
tecture will provide the framework for deploying 
the systems and technologies outlined in Austin’s 
Smart City vision. Austin is also committed to 
following the approach outlined in the Connected 
Vehicle Reference Implementation Architecture 
(CVRIA) for identifying and documenting interfac -
es and data flow between systems in a connected 
vehicle environment. The CVRIA approach, and in 
particular the SET-IT tool, will be used to develop 
project architectures for systems and application 
deployed through the MIC.
The City further plans to utilize the framework 
established by USDOT for certifying the system 
components and technologies deployed through 
the MIC. It is envisioned that certification will 
occur at the device and system levels to ensure 
accuracy, timeliness and integrity/security of 
over-the-air and other transmitted data, as well 
as the application level. When possible, the MIC 
will utilize supplier systems, technologies, and 
services that have been previously certified by 
USDOT. In cases where certification equipment 
does not exist, we will make use of the third party 
certification services, such as the OmniAir Certi -
fication Services led by the Southwest Research 
Institute, to coordinate and conduct certification 
testing.

26 11. MEASURABLE 
GOALS AND 
OBJECTIVES 
A cornerstone of Austin’s Smart City vision is that 
our goals and intended outcomes cannot just be 
aspirational statements; they must be measurable 
and achievable. Each Smart City initiative  – from 
the real-time operation of the MIC to the projects 
it will deploy – will be measured by a data-facili -
tated, stakeholder-driven, transparent perfor -
mance plan. The plans will be stakeholder-driven 
and transparent both in their development and use. 
The City of Austin and its partners have identified 
a series of goals and objectives which align with 
USDOT’s expected outcomes of the Smart City 
Challenge: enhance mobility; improve safety; and 
address climate change.  Efficiency, sustainability, 
and equity are other important goals, objectives 
of which are summarized in Table 3 . The data 
analysis will be used for reporting, but as impor -
tantly, also for improving day-to-day operations 
and investment decisions. 
To achieve these goals, Figure 4 on page 25   
presented a performance management process 
which will be made possible with complete 
implementation of the UAI.  The process may be 
summarized as follows:
Data is provided through smart sensor infra -
structure, connected citizens and vehicles, 
private sector sources, qualitative instruments, 
etc.

Urban Analytics Initiative is the engine that 
analyzes the data, produces key performance 
measures, compares them to targets, and 
identifies the amount and timing of deficiencies.  
Information is used to make decisions about 
whether the project or policy needs to be 
adjusted to meet mobility, safety, efficiency, 
sustainability, and climate change objectives.  
These may result in real-time deployment of 
resources, near-term changes in operations or 
longer term needs for innovation, investment 
or policy changes. Engagement in the form of internal agency 
operations reports and project, policy and 
overall Smart City dashboards are envisioned 
to connect MIC activities to Austinites.  
Those decisions produce outcomes that affect 
people, organizations and the environment.  
Outcomes also illuminate other questions and 
data needs completing a feedback loop that 
can be used for continuous monitoring and 
optimization.
Austin’s agencies have been sharing data 
and performance measures for many years in 
ad-hoc or project related efforts.  The value of 
Austin’s Smart City effort is that the interagency 
cooperation and coordination will be further 
incorporated into daily and annual multmodal 
and interdisciplinary decision-making processes. 
Austin’s Smart Growth Plan, for example, points 
to desired mobility targets at the neighborhood 
level that prioritize pedestrian, bike and transit 
improvements in densely developed areas, and 
operations treatments that improve travel time 
reliability along major travel corridors. The UAI can 
incorporate these priorities in real time to decide 
which problems need solutions and which are 
‘usual congestion’ - other urban areas can unlock 
the value of Austin’s Smart City efforts for their 
citizens, businesses, agencies, etc.  Local commit -
ment to such immensely successful events such 
as SXSW demonstrate that Austin is proficient in 
sharing results with the rest of the world – Aus -
tin’s Smart City commitment will join this list and 
ensure USDOT’s goal are met.

project staff.As Mayor Adler has championed, “We are 
100 percent committed to doing whatever it 
takes to make Austin the USDOT’s shining 
Smart City demonstration project for the 
nation.”  
The city will assign an experienced transportation 
professional to serve as the full-time Executive 
Director for the Austin Smart City Consortium. 
This commitment provides a politically savvy, lo -
cally engaged, and tested leader at the helm. His 
leadership has led to an estimated $4 billion work 
plan to improve I-35 with a number of projects 
underway; signal technology and roadway infra -
structure to support Capital Metro’s $48 million 
bus rapid transit system; and, a multi-million dollar 
pass through funding agreement with TxDOT to 
accelerate needed construction. The following 
summarizes additional key features of the City 
of Austin and its partners’ technical capacity to 
successfully deliver on the Smart City Challenge:
Governance Model:  Our Smart City Consortium 
governance model is a proven model. It is adapted 
from the successful model used for multi-agency 
governance of the region’s Combined Transporta -
tion, Emergency Communications Center (CTECC) 
since opening in 2003.
Regulatory and Political Environment:  Our 
readiness is also evidenced in our enabling regu -
latory and political environment and demonstrated 
by local real-world testing of self-driving vehicles. 
Smart land use is occurring through the City’s 
Imagine Austin Comprehensive Plan and updated 
CodeNEXT land development code.  Workforce Capacity : We will obtain new staff, 
consulting support, and additional program man -
agement support to free up the time of our most 
knowledgeable senior agency staff so that they 
can be available to the Smart City effort and the 
ongoing evolution of our mobility transformation. 
The Austin marketplace is also rich in technology 
and entrepreneurial talent that is available through 
our partnerships.
Infrastructure Readiness:  Austin Energy 
is owned by the City and ranks among the top 
four cities in the nation for electric vehicle public 
charging stations. Google is testing self-driving 
vehicles here. Shared-use mobility services are vi -
brant and growing. Capital Metro operates a vast 
transit network and envisions an all-electric fleet 
with innovative first and last mile connectivity. 
V2I projects are implemented. Austin’s transpor -
tation agencies have considerable investments in 
intelligent sensor-based infrastructure, software, 
dedicated transportation fiber networks, etc. Aus -
tin’s first managed lane project will be completed 
this year. 
Data Management Capabilities: Open data 
initiatives are implemented and expanding at 
multiple agencies. The private sector is accessing 
this data to improve services to their customers. 
The region is working with the University of Texas 
to develop a regional data warehouse to enhance 
access and analytical capabilities. 
Performance Management Capabilities: Aus-
tin’s agencies are data driven. Agencies routinely 
use quantitative and qualitative data to monitor 
performance, make improvements, measure Austin’s Strong Financial and 
Business Track Record
Financial Solvency  – The City of Austin an -
nually runs budget surpluses, and has a AAA 
bond rating. This is major discriminator and risk 
mitigation factor.
Proven Track Record with Business – The 
City continually makes Top Ten lists. Specifical -
ly, the best locations for business, most likely 
to succeed over the next ten years, best place 
to start a business, best place for millennials/
retirees, and others. 
Proven Record with Public-Private 
Partnerships (P3) – We’ve successfully un -
dertaken and completed many P3 projects, in 
the operations, development and infrastructure 
areas. These include private development, na -
tional launch of Car2Go and ParkMe, and  AE’s 
chilled water system and AWU’s reclaimed wa -
ter system, parks facilities, and development of 
public works infrastructure.

indicators with their governing bodies. 
Procurement: As procurement is a critical path 
item, Austin is already exploring paths to begin 
procurement processes now so we are ready to 
go upon receiving the award. 
13. OPPORTUNITIES 
TO LEVERAGE 
FEDERAL FUNDS
As Texans, we have not been – nor will we be 
– shy about asking our partners to contribute 
the resources necessary to meet USDOT’s ex -
pectations for delivering the national model of a 
first-rate Smart City. The City of Austin is honored 
by the outpouring of interest as demonstrated by 
the multitude of support letters from companies, 
agencies, and organizations seeking to partner 
with Austin on the Challenge. We are commu -
nicating to all potential and committed partners 
the expectation that they will go the extra mile 
to make Austin a highly competitive Smart City 
Challenge finalist – by generously contributing 
time, talent, and treasure. 
If awarded the Smart City Challenge grant, all 
organizations and companies identified in Section 
7 will be asked to go beyond policy support for 
our effort to provide actual – and substantive – 
financial support. Austin agencies have a track 
record of contributing resources to joint initia -
tives such as I-35 reconstruction, the BRT system, 
13and freeway interchange construction. The City 
will explore its funding mechanisms to further 
leverage Federal funds. TxDOT has engaged us in 
discussions about a major matching grant. Capital 
Metro, the CTRMA, CAMPO, Travis County, and 
the State of Texas are all on board as investment 
partners, expressing financial support for accel -
erating our vision.
Austin’s round two Smart City Challenge submis -
sion will provide more details on the robust com -
mitments from our project partners that we expect 
to fully leverage USDOT’s Smart City investment. 
The City and its partners have been excellent 
stewards of Federal grants for many years, and 
will continue to do so if awarded the Smart City 
Challenge grant.

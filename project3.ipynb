    "## Cleaning Up PDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more frustrating aspects of PDF is loading the data into a readable format. The first order of business will be to preprocess the data. To start, you can use code provided by Text Analytics with Python, [Chapter 3](https://github.com/dipanjanS/text-analytics-with-python/blob/master/New-Second-Edition/Ch03%20-%20Processing%20and%20Understanding%20Text/Ch03a%20-%20Text%20Wrangling.ipynb): [contractions.py](https://github.com/dipanjanS/text-analytics-with-python/blob/master/New-Second-Edition/Ch05%20-%20Text%20Classification/contractions.py) (Pages 136-137), and [text_normalizer.py](https://github.com/dipanjanS/text-analytics-with-python/blob/master/New-Second-Edition/Ch05%20-%20Text%20Classification/text_normalizer.py) (Pages 155-156). Feel free to download the scripts or add the code directly to the notebook (please note this code is performed on dataframes).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the data cleaning provided by the textbook, you will need to:\n",
    "1. Consider removing terms that may effect clustering and topic modeling. Words to consider are cities, states, common words (smart, city, page, etc.). Keep in mind n-gram combinations are important; this can also be revisited later depending on your model's performance.\n",
    "2. Check the data to remove applicants that text was not processed correctly. Do not remove more than 15 cities from the data.\n"
